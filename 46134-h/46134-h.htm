<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“New forces, new cravings, new aims, which had been
silently gathering beneath the crust of re-action, burst suddenly
into view.”&mdash;Green’s “Short History of the English People,”
Chap. x.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Change is consummated in many cases after much argument
and agitation, and men do not observe that almost everything
has been silently effected by causes to which few people
paid any heed. In one generation an institution is unassailable,
in the next bold men may assail it, and in the third bold
men defend it. At one time the most conclusive arguments
are advanced against it in vain, if indeed they are allowed
utterance at all. At another time the most childish sophistry
is enough to secure its condemnation. In the first place, the
institution, though probably indefensible by pure reason, was
congruous with the conscious habits and modes of thought of
the community. In the second, these had changed from influences
which the acutest analysis would probably fail to
explain, and a breath sufficed to topple over the sapped
structure.”&mdash;<i>The Times</i>, 27th November, 1891.</p></div>


<p>In these days of strong party feeling and of keenly-contested
social and religious issues, it might perhaps be
thought difficult to find a single question having a vital
bearing upon national life and well-being on which all
persons, no matter of what political party, or of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
shade of sociological opinion, would be found to be fully
and entirely agreed. Discuss the temperance cause, and
you will hear from Mr. John Morley that it is “the
greatest moral movement since the movement for the
abolition of slavery”; but Lord Bruce will remind you
that “every year the trade contributes £40,000,000 to the
revenue of the country, so that practically it maintains
the Army and Navy, besides which it affords employment
to many thousands of persons”&mdash;that “even the teetotalers
owe much to the licensed victuallers, for if it were
not for them the refreshment bars at the Crystal Palace
would have been closed long ago.” Discuss the opium
traffic, and, on the one hand, you will hear that opium is
rapidly destroying the <i>morale</i> of the people of China, and,
on the other, that this is quite a delusion, and that the
Chinese are capable, thanks to opium, of doing work
which to a European is quite impossible, and that on
food at which the least squeamish of English people
would turn up their noses in disgust.</p>

<p>Religious and political questions too often divide us
into hostile camps; and so, in the very realms where
calm, dispassionate thought and pure emotions are the
essentials of all advance towards right beliefs and sound
principles of action, the din of battle and the struggles of
contending hosts are more forcibly suggested to the on-looker
than the really sincere love of truth and love of
country which, one may yet be sure, animate nearly all
breasts.</p>

<p>There is, however, a question in regard to which one
can scarcely find any difference of opinion. It is well-nigh
universally agreed by men of all parties, not only in
England, but all over Europe and America and our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
colonies, that it is deeply to be deplored that the people
should continue to stream into the already over-crowded
cities, and should thus further deplete the country
districts.</p>

<p>Lord Rosebery, speaking some years ago as Chairman
of the London County Council, dwelt with very special
emphasis on this point:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There is no thought of pride associated in my mind with
the idea of London. I am always haunted by the awfulness of
London: by the great appalling fact of these millions cast
down, as it would appear by hazard, on the banks of this noble
stream, working each in their own groove and their own cell,
without regard or knowledge of each other, without heeding
each other, without having the slightest idea how the other
lives&mdash;the heedless casualty of unnumbered thousands of men.
Sixty years ago a great Englishman, Cobbett, called it a
wen. If it was a wen then, what is it now? A tumour, an
elephantiasis sucking into its gorged system half the life and
the blood and the bone of the rural districts.”&mdash;March, 1891.</p></div>

<p>Sir John Gorst points out the evil, and suggests the
remedy:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If they wanted a permanent remedy of the evil they must
remove the cause; they must back the tide, and stop the
migration of the people into the towns, and get the people
back to the land. The interest and the safety of the towns
themselves were involved in the solution of the problem.”&mdash;<i>Daily
Chronicle</i>, 6th November, 1891.</p></div>

<p>Dean Farrar says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We are becoming a land of great cities. Villages are
stationary or receding; cities are enormously increasing. And
if it be true that great cities tend more and more to become
the graves of the physique of our race, can we wonder at it
when we see the houses so foul, so squalid, so ill-drained, so
vitiated by neglect and dirt?”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Rhodes, at the Demographic Congress, called
attention to</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“the migration which was going on from the English agricultural
districts. In Lancashire and other manufacturing districts
35 per cent. of the population were over 60 years of age,
but in agricultural districts they would have over 60 per cent.
Many of the cottages were so abominable that they could not
call them houses, and the people so deteriorated in physique
that they were not able to do the amount of work which able-bodied
persons should do. Unless something was done to make
the lot of the agricultural labourer better, the exodus would go
on, with what results in the future he dared not say.”&mdash;<i>Times</i>,
15th August, 1891.</p></div>

<p>The Press, Liberal, Radical, and Conservative, views
this grave symptom of the time with the same alarm.
The <i>St. James’s Gazette</i>, on June 6, 1892, remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“How best to provide the proper antidote against the
greatest danger of modern existence is a question of no mean
significance.”</p></div>

<p><i>The Star</i>, 9th October, 1891, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“How to stem the drift from the country is one of the main
problems of the day. The labourer may perhaps be restored to
the land, but how will the country industries be restored to
rural England?”</p></div>

<p><i>The Daily News</i>, a few years ago, published a series of
articles, “Life in our Villages,” dealing with the same
problem.</p>

<p>Trade Unionist leaders utter the same note of
warning. Mr. Ben Tillett says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Hands are hungry for toil, and lands are starving for
labour.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Tom Mann observes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The congestion of labour in the metropolis is caused
mainly by the influx from the country districts of those who
were needed there to cultivate the land.”</p></div>

<p>All, then, are agreed on the pressing nature of this
problem, all are bent on its solution, and though it would
doubtless be quite Utopian to expect a similar agreement
as to the value of any remedy that may be proposed, it is
at least of immense importance that, on a subject thus
universally regarded as of supreme importance, we have
such a consensus of opinion at the outset. This will be
the more remarkable and the more hopeful sign when it
is shown, as I believe will be conclusively shown in this
work, that the answer to this, one of the most pressing
questions of the day, makes of comparatively easy solution
many other problems which have hitherto taxed the
ingenuity of the greatest thinkers and reformers of our
time. Yes, the key to the problem how to restore the
people to the land&mdash;that beautiful land of ours, with its
canopy of sky, the air that blows upon it, the sun that
warms it, the rain and dew that moisten it&mdash;the very
embodiment of Divine love for man&mdash;is indeed a <i>Master-Key</i>,
for it is the key to a portal through which, even
when scarce ajar, will be seen to pour a flood of light on
the problems of intemperance, of excessive toil, of restless
anxiety, of grinding poverty&mdash;the true limits of Governmental
interference, ay, and even the relations of man to
the Supreme Power.</p>

<p>It may perhaps be thought that the first step to be
taken towards the solution of this question&mdash;how to
restore the people to the land&mdash;would involve a careful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
consideration of the very numerous causes which have
hitherto led to their aggregation in large cities. Were
this the case, a very prolonged enquiry would be necessary
at the outset. Fortunately, alike for writer and for
reader, such an analysis is not, however, here requisite,
and for a very simple reason, which may be stated thus:&mdash;Whatever
may have been the causes which have
operated in the past, and are operating now, to draw the
people into the cities, those causes may all be summed up
as “attractions”; and it is obvious, therefore, that no
remedy can possibly be effective which will not present
to the people, or at least to considerable portions of them,
greater “attractions” than our cities now possess, so that
the force of the old “attractions” shall be overcome by
the force of new “attractions” which are to be created.
Each city may be regarded as a magnet, each person as a
needle; and, so viewed, it is at once seen that nothing
short of the discovery of a method for constructing
magnets of yet greater power than our cities possess can
be effective for re-distributing the population in a spontaneous
and healthy manner.</p>

<p>So presented, the problem may appear at first sight to
be difficult, if not impossible, of solution. “What,” some
may be disposed to ask, “can possibly be done to make
the country more attractive to a work-a-day people than
the town&mdash;to make wages, or at least the standard of
physical comfort, higher in the country than in the town;
to secure in the country equal possibilities of social intercourse,
and to make the prospects of advancement for the
average man or woman equal, not to say superior, to those
enjoyed in our large cities?” The issue one constantly
finds presented in a form very similar to that. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
subject is treated continually in the public press, and in
all forms of discussion, as though men, or at least
working-men, had not now, and never could have, any
choice or alternative, but either, on the one hand, to stifle
their love for human society&mdash;at least in wider relations
than can be found in a straggling village&mdash;or, on the
other hand, to forego almost entirely all the keen and
pure delights of the country. The question is universally
considered as though it were now, and for ever must
remain, quite impossible for working people to live in the
country and yet be engaged in pursuits other than agricultural;
as though crowded, unhealthy cities were the
last word of economic science; and as if our present form
of industry, in which sharp lines divide agricultural from
industrial pursuits, were necessarily an enduring one.
This fallacy is the very common one of ignoring altogether
the possibility of alternatives other than those presented
to the mind. There are in reality not only, as is so constantly
assumed, two alternatives&mdash;town life and country
life&mdash;but a third alternative, in which all the advantages
of the most energetic and active town life, with all the
beauty and delight of the country, may be secured in
perfect combination; and the certainty of being able to
live this life will be the magnet which will produce the
effect for which we are all striving&mdash;the spontaneous
movement of the people from our crowded cities to the
bosom of our kindly mother earth, at once the source of
life, of happiness, of wealth, and of power. The town
and the country may, therefore, be regarded as two
magnets, each striving to draw the people to itself&mdash;a
rivalry which a new form of life, partaking of the nature
of both, comes to take part in. This may be illustrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
by a diagram of “The Three Magnets,” in which the
chief advantages of the Town and of the Country are set
forth with their corresponding drawbacks, while the advantages
of the Town-Country are seen to be free from
the disadvantages of either.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 449px;">
<a href="images/ill_016ah.png">
<img src="images/ill_016a.png" width="449" height="500" alt="No. 1 The Three Magnets" />
</a></div>


<p>The Town magnet, it will be seen, offers, as compared
with the Country magnet, the advantages of high wages,
opportunities for employment, tempting prospects of advancement,
but these are largely counterbalanced by high
rents and prices. Its social opportunities and its places
of amusement are very alluring, but excessive hours of
toil, distance from work, and the “isolation of crowds”
tend greatly to reduce the value of these good things.
The well-lit streets are a great attraction, especially in
winter, but the sunlight is being more and more shut out,
while the air is so vitiated that the fine public buildings,
like the sparrows, rapidly become covered with soot, and
the very statues are in despair. Palatial edifices and
fearful slums are the strange, complementary features of
modern cities.</p>

<p>The Country magnet declares herself to be the source
of all beauty and wealth; but the Town magnet
mockingly reminds her that she is very dull for lack of
society, and very sparing of her gifts for lack of capital.
There are in the country beautiful vistas, lordly parks,
violet-scented woods, fresh air, sounds of rippling water;
but too often one sees those threatening words, “Trespassers
will be prosecuted.” Rents, if estimated by the
acre, are certainly low, but such low rents are the natural
fruit of low wages rather than a cause of substantial
comfort; while long hours and lack of amusements forbid
the bright sunshine and the pure air to gladden the hearts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
of the people. The one industry, agriculture, suffers frequently
from excessive rainfalls; but this wondrous
harvest of the clouds is seldom properly ingathered, so
that, in times of drought, there is frequently, even for
drinking purposes, a most insufficient supply.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Even the
natural healthfulness of the country is largely lost for
lack of proper drainage and other sanitary conditions,
while, in parts almost deserted by the people, the few
who remain are yet frequently huddled together as if in
rivalry with the slums of our cities.</p>

<p>But neither the Town magnet nor the Country magnet
represents the full plan and purpose of nature. Human
society and the beauty of nature are meant to be enjoyed
together. The two magnets must be made one. As man
and woman by their varied gifts and faculties supplement
each other, so should town and country. The town is
the symbol of society&mdash;of mutual help and friendly co-operation,
of fatherhood, motherhood, brotherhood, sisterhood,
of wide relations between man and man&mdash;of broad,
expanding sympathies&mdash;of science, art, culture, religion.
And the country! The country is the symbol of God’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
love and care for man. All that we are and all that we
have comes from it. Our bodies are formed of it; to it
they return. We are fed by it, clothed by it, and by it
are we warmed and sheltered. On its bosom we rest.
Its beauty is the inspiration of art, of music, of poetry.
Its forces propel all the wheels of industry. It is the
source of all health, all wealth, all knowledge. But its
fulness of joy and wisdom has not revealed itself to man.
Nor can it ever, so long as this unholy, unnatural separation
of society and nature endures. Town and country
<i>must be married</i>, and out of this joyous union will spring
a new hope, a new life, a new civilisation. It is the
purpose of this work to show how a first step can be taken
in this direction by the construction of a Town-country
magnet; and I hope to convince the reader that this is
practicable, here and now, and that on principles which
are the very soundest, whether viewed from the ethical
or the economic standpoint.</p>

<p>I will undertake, then, to show how in “Town-country”
equal, nay better, opportunities of social intercourse
may be enjoyed than are enjoyed in any crowded

<p>The construction of such a magnet, could it be
effected, followed, as it would be, by the construction of
many more, would certainly afford a solution of the
burning question set before us by Sir John Gorst, “how
to back the tide of migration of the people into the towns,
and to get them back upon the land.”</p>

<p>A fuller description of such a magnet and its mode of
construction will form the theme of subsequent chapters.</p>

<p>The reader is asked to imagine an estate embracing an
area of 6,000 acres, which is at present purely agricultural,
and has been obtained by purchase in the open
market at a cost of £40<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> an acre, or £240,000. The purchase
money is supposed to have been raised on mortgage
debentures, bearing interest at an average rate not ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>ceeding
£4 per cent.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The estate is legally vested in the
names of four gentlemen of responsible position and of
undoubted probity and honour, who hold it in trust, first,
as a security for the debenture-holders, and, secondly, in
trust for the people of Garden City, the Town-country
magnet, which it is intended to build thereon. One
essential feature of the plan is that all ground rents,
which are to be based upon the annual value of the land,
shall be paid to the trustees, who, after providing for
interest and sinking fund, will hand the balance to the
Central Council of the new municipality,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> to be employed
by such Council in the creation and maintenance of all
necessary public works&mdash;roads, schools, parks, etc.</p>

<p>The objects of this land purchase may be stated in
various ways, but it is sufficient here to say that some of
the chief objects are these: To find for our industrial
population work at wages of <i>higher purchasing power</i>,
and to secure healthier surroundings and more regular
employment. To enterprising manufacturers, co-operative
societies, architects, engineers, builders, and
mechanicians of all kinds, as well as to many engaged in
various professions, it is intended to offer a means of
securing new and better employment for their capital
and talents, while to the agriculturists at present
on the estate, as well as to those who may migrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
thither, it is designed to open a new market for their
produce close to their doors. Its object is, in short, to
raise the standard of health and comfort of all true
workers of whatever grade&mdash;the means by which these
objects are to be achieved being a healthy, natural, and
economic combination of town and country life, and this
on land owned by the municipality.</p>

</div>

<p>Garden City, which is to be built near the centre of
the 6,000 acres, covers an area of 1,000 acres, or a sixth
part of the 6,000 acres, and might be of circular form,
1,240 yards (or nearly three-quarters of a mile) from
centre to circumference. (Diagram 2 is a ground-plan of
the whole municipal area, showing the town in the
centre; and Diagram 3, which represents one section or
ward of the town, will be useful in following the description
of the town itself&mdash;<b>a description which is, however,
merely suggestive, and will probably be much
departed from</b>.)</p>

<p>Six magnificent boulevards&mdash;each 120 feet wide&mdash;traverse
the city from centre to circumference, dividing
it into six equal parts or wards. In the centre is a
circular space containing about five and a half acres, laid
out as a beautiful and well-watered garden; and, surrounding
this garden, each standing in its own ample
grounds, are the larger public buildings&mdash;town hall,
principal concert and lecture hall, theatre, library,
museum, picture-gallery, and hospital.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/ill_022ch.png">
<img src="images/ill_022c.png" width="500" height="426" alt="No. 3 Ward and Centre Garden City" />
</a>
</div>

<p>The rest of the large space encircled by the “Crystal
Palace” is a public park, containing 145 acres, which
includes ample recreation grounds within very easy access
of all the people.</p>

<p>Running all round the Central Park (except where it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
is intersected by the boulevards) is a wide glass arcade
called the “Crystal Palace,” opening on to the park.
This building is in wet weather one of the favourite
resorts of the people, whilst the knowledge that its bright
shelter is ever close at hand tempts people into Central
Park, even in the most doubtful of weathers. Here
manufactured goods are exposed for sale, and here most
of that class of shopping which requires the joy of
deliberation and selection is done. The space enclosed by
the Crystal Palace is, however, a good deal larger than is
required for these purposes, and a considerable part of it
is used as a Winter Garden&mdash;the whole forming a permanent
exhibition of a most attractive character, whilst
its circular form brings it near to every dweller in the
town&mdash;the furthest removed inhabitant being within 600
yards.</p>

<p>Passing out of the Crystal Palace on our way to the
outer ring of the town, we cross Fifth Avenue&mdash;lined, as
are all the roads of the town, with trees&mdash;fronting which,
and looking on to the Crystal Palace, we find a ring of
very excellently-built houses, each standing in its own
ample grounds; and, as we continue our walk, we observe
that the houses are for the most part built either in concentric
rings, facing the various avenues (as the circular
roads are termed), or fronting the boulevards and roads,
which all converge to the centre of the town. Asking
the friend who accompanies us on our journey what the
population of this little city may be, we are told about
30,000 in the city itself, and about 2,000 in the agricultural
estate, and that there are in the town 5,500
building lots of an <i>average</i> size of 20 feet × 130 feet&mdash;the
minimum space allotted for the purpose being 20 × 100.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Noticing the very varied architecture and design which
the houses and groups of houses display&mdash;some having
common gardens and co-operative kitchens&mdash;we learn
that general observance of street line or harmonious
departure from it are the chief points as to house-building
over which the municipal authorities exercise control, for,
though proper sanitary arrangements are strictly enforced,
the fullest measure of individual taste and preference
is encouraged.</p>

<p>Walking still toward the outskirts of the town, we
come upon “Grand Avenue.” This avenue is fully entitled
to the name it bears, for it is 420 feet wide,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and,
forming a belt of green upwards of three miles long,
divides that part of the town which lies outside Central
Park into two belts. It really constitutes an additional
park of 115 acres&mdash;a park which is within 240 yards of
the furthest removed inhabitant. In this splendid
avenue six sites, each of four acres, are occupied by
public schools and their surrounding play-grounds and
gardens, while other sites are reserved for churches, of
such denominations as the religious beliefs of the people
may determine, to be erected and maintained out of the
funds of the worshippers and their friends. We observe
that the houses fronting on Grand Avenue have departed
(at least in one of the wards&mdash;that of which Diagram 3 is
a representation)&mdash;from the general plan of concentric
rings, and, in order to ensure a longer line of frontage on
Grand Avenue, are arranged in crescents&mdash;thus also to
the eye yet further enlarging the already splendid width
of Grand Avenue.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<p>On the outer ring of the town are factories, warehouses,
dairies, markets, coal yards, timber yards, etc.,
all fronting on the circle railway, which encompasses the
whole town, and which has sidings connecting it with a
main line of railway which passes through the estate.
This arrangement enables goods to be loaded direct into
trucks from the warehouses and workshops, and so sent
by railway to distant markets, or to be taken direct from
the trucks into the warehouses or factories; thus not only
effecting a very great saving in regard to packing and
cartage, and reducing to a minimum loss from breakage,
but also, by reducing the traffic on the roads of the town,
lessening to a very marked extent the cost of their
maintenance. The smoke fiend is kept well within
bounds in Garden City; for all machinery is driven by
electric energy, with the result that the cost of electricity
for lighting and other purposes is greatly reduced.</p>

<p>The refuse of the town is utilised on the agricultural
portions of the estate, which are held by various individuals
in large farms, small holdings, allotments, cow
pastures, etc.; the natural competition of these various
methods of agriculture, tested by the willingness of
occupiers to offer the highest rent to the municipality,
tending to bring about the best system of husbandry, or,
what is more probable, the best <i>systems</i> adapted for
various purposes. Thus it is easily conceivable that it
may prove advantageous to grow wheat in very large
fields, involving united action under a capitalist farmer,
or by a body of co-operators; while the cultivation of
vegetables, fruits, and flowers, which requires closer and
more personal care, and more of the artistic and inventive
faculty, may possibly be best dealt with by individuals, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
by small groups of individuals having a common belief in
the efficacy and value of certain dressings, methods of
culture, or artificial and natural surroundings.</p>

<p>This plan, or, if the reader be pleased to so term it,
this absence of plan, avoids the dangers of stagnation or
dead level, and, though encouraging individual initiative,
permits of the fullest co-operation, while the increased
rents which follow from this form of competition are
common or municipal property, and by far the larger
part of them are expended in permanent improvements.</p>

<p>While the town proper, with its population engaged
in various trades, callings, and professions, and with a
store or depôt in each ward, offers the most natural
market to the people engaged on the agricultural estate,
inasmuch as to the extent to which the townspeople
demand their produce they escape altogether any railway
rates and charges; yet the farmers and others are not
by any means limited to the town as their only market,
but have the fullest right to dispose of their produce to
whomsoever they please. Here, as in every feature of
the experiment, it will be seen that it is not the area of
rights which is contracted, but the area of choice which
is enlarged.</p>

<p>This principle of freedom holds good with regard to
manufacturers and others who have established themselves
in the town. These manage their affairs in their
own way, subject, of course, to the general law of the
land, and subject to the provision of sufficient space for
workmen and reasonable sanitary conditions. Even in
regard to such matters as water, lighting, and telephonic
communication&mdash;which a municipality, if efficient and
honest, is certainly the best and most natural body to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
supply&mdash;no rigid or absolute monopoly is sought; and if
any private corporation or any body of individuals
proved itself capable of supplying on more advantageous
terms, either the whole town or a section of it, with these
or any commodities the supply of which was taken up by
the corporation, this would be allowed. No really sound
system of <i>action</i> is in more need of artificial support than
is any sound system of <i>thought</i>. The area of municipal
and corporate action is probably destined to become
greatly enlarged; but, if it is to be so, it will be because
the people possess faith in such action, and that faith
can be best shown by a wide extension of the area of
freedom.</p>

<p>Dotted about the estate are seen various charitable
and philanthropic institutions. These are not under the
control of the municipality, but are supported and
managed by various public-spirited people who have been
invited by the municipality to establish these institutions
in an open healthy district, and on land let to them at a
pepper-corn rent, it occurring to the authorities that they
can the better afford to be thus generous, as the spending
power of these institutions greatly benefits the whole
community. Besides, as those persons who migrate to
the town are among its most energetic and resourceful
members, it is but just and right that their more helpless
brethren should be able to enjoy the benefits of an experiment
which is designed for humanity at large.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

<span class="smaller">THE REVENUE OF GARDEN CITY, AND HOW IT IS OBTAINED&mdash;THE
AGRICULTURAL ESTATE.</span></h2>


<p>Amongst the essential differences between Garden City
and other municipalities, one of the chief is its method
of raising its revenue. Its entire revenue is derived from
rents; and one of the purposes of this work is to show
that the rents which may very reasonably be expected
from the various tenants on the estate will be amply
sufficient, if paid into the coffers of Garden City, (<i>a</i>) to
pay the interest on the money with which the estate is
purchased, (<i>b</i>) to provide a sinking-fund for the purpose
of paying off the principal, (<i>c</i>) to construct and maintain
all such works as are usually constructed and maintained
by municipal and other local authorities out of rates compulsorily
levied, and (<i>d</i>) (after redemption of debentures)
to provide a large surplus for other purposes, such as old-age
pensions or insurance against accident and sickness.</p>

<p>Perhaps no difference between town and country is
more noticeable than the difference in the rent charged
for the use of the soil. Thus, while in some parts of
London the rent is equal to £30,000 an acre, £4 an acre
is an extremely high rent for agricultural land. This
enormous difference of rental value is, of course, almost
entirely due to the presence in the one case and the
absence in the other of a large population; and, as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
cannot be attributed to the action of any particular individuals,
it is frequently spoken of as the “unearned
increment,” <i>i.e.</i>, unearned by the landlord, though a more
correct term would be “collectively-earned increment.”</p>

<p>The presence of a considerable population thus giving
a greatly additional value to the soil, it is obvious that a
migration of population on any considerable scale to any
particular area will be certainly attended with a corresponding
rise in the value of the land so settled upon,
and it is also obvious that such increment of value may,
with some foresight and pre-arrangement, become the property
of the migrating people.</p>

<p>Such foresight and pre-arrangement, never before
exercised in an effective manner, are displayed conspicuously
in the case of Garden City, where the land, as
we have seen, is vested in trustees, who hold it in trust
(after payment of the debentures) for the whole community,
so that the entire increment of value gradually
created becomes the property of the municipality, with
the effect that though rents may rise, and even rise considerably,
such rise in rent will not become the property
of private individuals, but will be applied in relief of
rates. It is this arrangement which will be seen to give
Garden City much of its magnetic power.</p>

<p>The site of Garden City we have taken to be worth at
the time of its purchase £40 an acre, or £240,000. The
purchase money may be assumed to represent 30 years’
purchase, and on this basis the annual rent paid by the
former tenants was £8,000. If, therefore, there was a
population of 1,000 persons upon the estate at the time of
the purchase, then each man, woman, and child was contributing
towards this rent-roll an average sum of £8 per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
annum. But the population of Garden City, including
its agricultural land, is, when completed, 32,000, and the
estate has cost them a sum on which they pay an annual
charge by way of interest of £9,600. Thus, while before
the experiment was initiated, 1,000 persons out of their
united earnings contributed £8,000 a year, or <i>£8 a head</i>,
on the completion of the town 32,000 persons out of their
united earnings will contribute £9,600 a year, or an
average of <i>6s. a head</i>.</p>

<p>This sum of 6s. per head per annum is all the rent,
strictly speaking, which the inhabitants of Garden City
will ever be called upon to pay; for it is all the rent
which they <i>pay away</i>, any further sum they pay being a
contribution towards their rates.</p>

<p>Let us now suppose that each person, besides contributing
annually 6s. a head, contributes an average annual
sum of £1 14s., or £2 in all. In that case two things may
be noticed. First, each person will be paying for ground
rent and rates only one-fourth of the sum which each
person before the purchase paid in ground-rent alone;
and, secondly, the Board of Management, after the payment
of interest on the debentures, will receive an annual
sum of £54,400, which, as will be presently shown, would,
after providing a sinking fund (of £4,400), defray all
those costs, charges, and expenses which are usually met
by local taxation.</p>

<p>The average annual sum contributed by each man,
woman, and child in England and Wales for local purposes
is about £2 a head, and the average sum contributed
for ground rent is, at a very low estimate, about
£2 10s. The average yearly contribution for ground-rent
and local rates is, therefore, about £4 10s. It might,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
therefore, be safely assumed that the people of Garden
City would willingly pay £2 per head in complete discharge
of ground-rent and local rates; but to make the
case the clearer and stronger, we will test the supposed
willingness of the tenants of Garden City to pay such a
sum as £2 a year for rates and rents in another way.</p>

<p>For this purpose, let us deal first with the agricultural
estate, leaving the town estate to be dealt with separately.
Obviously the rent which can be secured will be considerably
greater than before the town was built. Every
farmer now has a market close to his doors. There are
30,000 townspeople to be fed. Those persons, of course,
are perfectly free to get their food stuffs from any part of
the world, and in the case of many products will doubtless
continue to be supplied from abroad. These farmers
are hardly likely to supply them with tea, with coffee,
with spices, with tropical fruits or with sugar,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and their
struggle to compete with America and Russia for the
supply of wheat or flour to the town may be as keen as
ever. But surely the struggle will not be so despairing.
A ray&mdash;a beam of hope will gladden the heart of the
despairing home-producer of wheat, for while the
American has to pay railway charges to the sea-board,
charges for Atlantic transit and railway charges to the
consumer, the farmer of Garden City has a market at his
very doors, and this a market which the rent he contributes
will help to build up.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Or, consider vegetables and fruits. Farmers, except
near towns, do not often grow them now. Why? Chiefly
because of the difficulty and uncertainty of a market, and
the high charges for freights and commission. To quote
the words of Dr. Farquharson, M.P., when they “try to
dispose of these things they find themselves struggling so
hopelessly in a spider’s web of rings, and middlemen, and
speculators, that they are more than half-inclined to give
up the attempt in despair, and fall back on those things
that stand up straight and square to their prices in the
open market.” A curious calculation may be interesting
with regard to milk. Assuming each person in the town
consumed only one-third of a pint a day, then 30,000
would consume 1,250 gallons a day, and might thus save,
taking railway charges at a penny per gallon, upwards
of £1,900 per annum in railway rates upon the one item
of milk, a saving which must be multiplied by a large
figure in order to realise the general saving to be effected
by placing consumer and producer in such close association.
In other words, the combination of town and
country is not only healthful, but economic&mdash;a point
which every step taken will serve to make yet more clear.</p>

<p>But the rents which the agricultural tenants of
Garden City would be willing to pay would increase for
another reason. The waste products of the town could,
and this without heavy charges for railway transport or
other expensive agencies, be readily brought back to the
soil, thus increasing its fertility. The question of sewage
disposal is naturally a difficult one to deal with, but its
inherent difficulty is often much increased by artificial
and imperfect conditions already in existence. Thus, Sir
Benjamin Baker, in his joint report with Mr. (now Sir)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Alexander Binnie to the London County Council, says:
“In approaching the consideration of the vast question
of the whole sewerage system of the Metropolis, and the
state of the Thames, as a practical problem ... we
had clearly at once to recognise the fact that the general
features of the main drainage system were unalterably
settled, and must be accepted in the same way as the
main lines of thoroughfares have to be accepted whether
quite as we could wish them to be or not.” But on
Garden City site, given the skilful engineer, he would
have comparatively little difficulty. He would have, as
it were, a clean sheet on which to prepare his plans, and
the whole estate being equally the property of the municipality,
he would have a free course before him, and
would doubtless succeed in adding greatly to the productiveness
of the agricultural estate.</p>

<p>The great increase in the number of allotments,
especially such favourably situated allotments as are
shown in Diagram 2, would also tend to raise the total
sum offered in rent.</p>

<p>There are yet other reasons why the rent which a
farmer on the Garden City estate would be willing to pay
for his farm, or a labourer for his allotment, would tend
to increase. The productiveness of the agricultural part
of the estate, besides being increased by a well-devised
system of sewage disposal, and by a new and somewhat
extensive market, with unique conveniences for transit
to more distant markets, would also be increased because
the tenure on which the land is held encourages
maximum cultivation. It is a just tenure. The agricultural
portion of the estate is let at fair rents, with a
right to continue in occupation as long as the tenant is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
willing to pay a rent equal to that offered by any would-be
occupier, less, say, 10 per cent. in favour of the occupying
tenant&mdash;the incoming tenant having also to compensate
the outgoing tenant for all unexhausted improvements.
Under this system, while it would be impossible
for the tenant to secure to himself any undue share of
that natural increment of land-value which would be
brought about by the general growth in well-being of the
town, he would yet have, as all tenants in possession
probably should have, a preference over any new-comer,
and would know that he would not lose those fruits of
his past industry which were not yet ingathered but were
still adding their value to the soil. Surely no one can
doubt that such a tenure would, of itself, tend greatly to
increase at once the activity and industry of the tenant,
the productivity of the soil, and the rent which the tenant
would be willing to pay.</p>

<p>That there would be this increased offer of rent will
become yet more obvious if we consider for a moment the
<i>nature</i> of the rent paid by a tenant of Garden City. Part
of what he pays would be in respect of interest on the
debentures on which the money to purchase the estate
was raised, or in the redemption of those debentures,
and would thus, except so far as the debentures were held
by residents on the estate, pass away from the community
altogether; but the whole of the remaining sum paid
would be expended locally, and the farmer would have a
share equal to that of every adult in the administration
of such money. The term “rent,” therefore, has, in
Garden City, acquired a new meaning, and, for the sake
of clearness, it will be necessary in future to use terms
which will not be ambiguous. That part of the rent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
which represents interest on debentures will be hereafter
called “landlord’s rent”; that part which represents
repayment of purchase-money “sinking fund”; that part
which is devoted to public purposes “rates”; while the
total sum will be termed “rate-rent.”</p>

<p>From these considerations, surely it is obvious that the
“<i>rate-rent</i>” which the farmer will be willing to pay into
the treasury of Garden City will be considerably higher
than the <i>rent</i> he would be willing to pay to a private
landlord, who, besides increasing his rent as the farmer
makes his land more valuable, will also leave him with
the full burden of local taxation resting upon him. In
short the plan proposed embraces a system of sewage-disposal
which will return to the soil in a transmuted
form many of those products the growth of which,
by exhausting its natural fertility, demand elsewhere
the application of manures so expensive that the
farmer becomes sometimes blinded to their necessity,
and it also embraces a system of rate-rents by which
many of the farmer’s hard-earned sovereigns, hitherto lost
to him by being paid away to his landlord, shall return to
his exhausted exchequer, not indeed in the form in which
they left it, but in a variety of useful forms, such as
roads, schools, markets, which will assist him most
materially, though indirectly, in his work, but which,
under present conditions, entail so severe a burden as to
make him naturally slow to see their inherent necessity,
and even to look upon some of them with suspicion and
dislike. Who can doubt that if the farm and the farmer
can be placed under conditions so healthful and natural
alike in a physical and moral sense, the willing soil and
the hopeful farmer will alike respond to their new environment&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
soil becoming more fertile by every blade
of grass it yields, the farmer richer by every penny of
rate-rent he contributes?</p>

<p>We are now in a position to see that the rate-rent
which will be readily paid by farmer, small occupier, and
allotment holder, would be considerably greater than the
rent he paid before (1) because of the presence of a new
town population demanding new and more profitable
farm products, in respect of which railway charges can be
largely saved; (2) by the due return to the soil of its
natural elements; (3) by the just, equitable, and natural
conditions on which the land is held; and (4) by reason
of the fact that the rent now paid is <i>rate and rent</i>, while
the rent formerly paid left the rates to be paid by the
tenant.</p>

<p>But certain as it is that the “<i>rate-rent</i>” would represent
a very considerable increase over the bare <i>rent</i>
formerly paid by the tenants on the estate, it is still very
much a matter of conjecture what the “rate-rent” would
be; and we shall, therefore, be acting prudently if we
greatly under-estimate the “rate-rent” which would probably
be offered. If, then, in view of all the circumstances,
we estimate that the <i>farming population</i> of
Garden City will be prepared to pay for rates and rent
50 per cent. more than they before paid for <i>rent alone</i>,
we shall reach the following result:&mdash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

<span class="smaller">THE REVENUE OF GARDEN CITY&mdash;TOWN ESTATE.</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Whatever reforms be introduced into the dwellings of the
London poor, it will still remain true that the whole area of
London is insufficient to supply its population with fresh air
and the free space that is wanted for wholesome recreation. A
remedy for the overcrowding of London will still be wanted....
There are large classes of the population of London
whose removal into the country would be in the long run
economically advantageous; it would benefit alike those who
moved and those who remained behind.... Of the 150,000
or more hired workers in the clothes-making trades, by far the
greater part are very poorly paid, and do work which it is
against all economic reason to have done where ground-rent is
high.”&mdash;Professor Marshall, “The Housing of the London
Poor,” <i>Contemporary Review</i>, 1884.</p></div>


<p>Having in the last chapter estimated the gross revenue
which may be anticipated from the agricultural part of
the estate at £9,750, we will now turn to the town estate
(where, obviously, the conversion of an agricultural area
into a town will be attended with a very large rise in land
values), and endeavour roughly to estimate&mdash;again taking
care to keep well within the mark&mdash;the amount of “rate-rent”
which will be freely offered by the tenants of the
town estate.</p>

<p>The site of the town proper consists, it will be remembered,
of 1,000 acres, and is assumed to have cost £40,000,
the interest of which, at 4 per cent., is £1,600 per annum.
This sum of £1,600 is, therefore, all the landlord’s rent
which the people of the town site will be called upon to
pay, any additional “rate-rent” they may contribute
being devoted either to the payment of the purchase-money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
as “sinking-fund,” or applied as “rates” to the
construction and maintenance of roads, schools, waterworks,
and to other municipal purposes. It will be
interesting, therefore, to see what sort of a burden
“landlord’s rent” will represent per head, and what
the community would secure by such contribution.
Now, if the sum of £1,600, being the annual interest or
“landlord’s rent,” be divided by 30,000 (the supposed
population of the town), it will be found to equal an
annual contribution by each man, woman, and child of
<i>rather less than 1s. 1d. per head</i>. This is all the “landlord’s
rent” which will ever be levied, any additional sum
collected as “rate-rent” being applied to sinking-fund
or to local purposes.</p>

<p>And now let us notice what this fortunately-placed
community obtains for this insignificant sum. It obtains
for 1s. 1d. per head per annum, first, ample sites for
homes, these averaging, as we have seen, 20 feet by 130
feet, and accommodating, on an average, 5&frac12; persons to
each lot. It obtains ample space for roads, some of
which are of truly magnificent proportions, so wide and
spacious that sunlight and air may freely circulate, and
in which trees, shrubs, and grass give to the town a
semi-rural appearance. It also obtains ample sites for
town-hall, public library, museum and picture-gallery,
theatre, concert-hall, hospital, schools, churches, swimming
baths, public markets, etc. It also secures a central park
of 145 acres, and a magnificent avenue 420 feet wide,
extending in a circle of over three miles, unbroken save
by spacious boulevards and by schools and churches,
which, one may be sure, will not be the less beautiful
because so little money has been expended on their sites.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
It secures also all the land required for a railway 4&frac14;
miles long, encompassing the town; 82 acres for warehouses,
factories, markets, and a splendid site for a
crystal palace devoted to shopping, and serving also as a
winter garden.</p>

<p>The leases under which all building sites are let do
not, therefore, contain the usual covenant by the tenant
to pay all rates, taxes, and assessments levied in respect
of such property, but, on the contrary, contain a covenant
by the landlord to apply the whole sum received, first, in
payment of debenture interest; secondly, towards the
redemption of the debentures; and thirdly, as to the
whole of the balance, into a public fund, to be applied to
public purposes, among these being the rates levied by
public authorities, other than the municipal authority,
of the city.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Let us now attempt to estimate the rate-rents which
may be anticipated in respect of our town-estate.</p>

<p>First, we will deal with the home-building lots. All
are excellently situated, but those fronting Grand Avenue
(420 feet) and the magnificent boulevards (120 feet)
would probably call forth the highest tenders. We can
here deal only with averages, but we think anyone would
admit that an average rate-rent of 6s. a foot frontage for
home lots would be extremely moderate. <i>This would
make the rate-rent of a building lot 20 feet wide in an
average position £6 a year, and on this basis the 5,500
building lots would yield a gross revenue of £33,000.</i></p>

<p>The rate-rents from the sites of factories, warehouses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
markets, etc., cannot perhaps be so well estimated by the
foot frontage, but we may perhaps safely assume that
an average employer would willingly pay £2 in respect of
each employee. It is, of course, not suggested that the
rate-rent levied should be a poll-tax; it would, as has been
said, be raised by competition among the tenants; but this
way of estimating rate-rent to be paid will perhaps give a
ready means by which manufacturers or other employers,
co-operative societies, or individuals working on their own
account, would be able to judge whether they would be
lightly rated and rented as compared with their present
position. It must be, however, distinctly borne in mind
that we are dealing with <i>averages</i>; and if the figure
should seem high to a large employer, it will seem
ridiculously low to a small shopkeeper.</p>

<p>Now, in a town with a population of 30,000, there
would be about twenty thousand persons between the
ages of 16 and 65; and if it is assumed that 10,625 of
these would be employed in factories, shops, warehouses,
markets, etc., or in any way which involved the use of a
site, other than a home-building site, to be leased from
the municipality, there would be a revenue from this
source of £21,250.</p>

<p>The gross revenue of the entire estate would therefore
be:&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">Rate-rent</td><td class="left">from agricultural estate (<i>see</i> p. <a href="#Page_36">36</a>),</td><td class="right">£9,750</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>Or £2 per head of population for rates and rent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>This sum would be available as follows:&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">For landlord’s rent or interest on purchase money £240,000 at 4 per cent.,</td><td class="right">£9,600</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">For such purposes as are elsewhere defrayed out of rates,</td><td class="right">50,000</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td class="total right">£64,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>It is now important to inquire whether £50,000 will
suffice for the municipal needs of Garden City.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<span class="smaller">THE REVENUE OF GARDEN CITY&mdash;GENERAL OBSERVATIONS
ON ITS EXPENDITURE.</span></h2>


<p>Before entering upon the question which presented itself
at the conclusion of the last chapter&mdash;that of endeavouring
to ascertain whether the estimated net available
income of Garden City (£50,000 per annum) would be
sufficient for its municipal needs, I will very shortly state
how it is proposed to raise the money required for commencing
operations. The money would be borrowed on
“B” debentures,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and would be secured by a charge upon
the “rate-rent,” subject, of course, to the payment of
interest and sinking fund in respect of the “A” debentures
on which the purchase money of the estate is raised.
It is, perhaps, superfluous to remark that, though in the
case of the land purchase it might be requisite to raise
the whole, or at least some very considerable part of the
purchase money before possession would be given of the
estate, or operations upon it commenced, yet in regard to
public works to be carried out upon the estate, the case
is quite different, and it would be by no means necessary
or advisable to defer the commencement of operations
until the whole sum which might be ultimately required
should be raised. Probably no town was ever built on
such onerous conditions as would be involved in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
raising at the outset of such a very considerable sum as
would defray the cost of all its public works; and though
the circumstances under which Garden City is to be
built may be unique, there is, as will by and by be seen,
not only no need for making an exception of the town in
respect of initial capital, but quite exceptional reasons
will become more and more apparent which make the
overlaying of the enterprise with superabundant capital
altogether unnecessary, and therefore inexpedient; although,
of course, there must be a sufficient sum to enable
all real economies to be readily effected.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may be well in this connection to draw a
distinction as to the amount of capital required between
the case of the building of a town and the building, let us
say, of a large iron bridge across an estuary. In the case
of the bridge it is highly expedient to raise the entire sum
required before commencing operations, for the simple
reason that the bridge is not a bridge until the last rivet
is driven home, nor, until its entire completion and its
connection with the railways or roadways at either end,
has it any revenue-earning power. Except, therefore, on
the assumption that it is to be fully completed, it offers
very little security for the capital sunk upon it. Hence
it would be very natural for those who are asked to
invest to say, “We will not put any money into this
enterprise until you show us that you can get enough to
complete it.” But the money which it is proposed to
raise for the development of Garden City site leads to
speedy results. It is to be expended upon roads, schools,
etc. These works will be carried out with due regard to
the number of lots which have been let to tenants, who
undertake to build as from a certain date; and, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the money expended will very soon begin to yield a return
in the shape of a rate-rent, representing, in reality, a
greatly-improved ground-rent; when those who have
advanced money on the “B” debentures will have a
really first-class security, and further sums should be
easily obtainable, and at a reduced rate of interest.
Again, it is an important part of the project that each
ward, or one-sixth part of the city, should be in some
sense a complete town by itself, and thus the school
buildings might serve, in the earlier stages, not only as
schools, but as places for religious worship, for concerts,
for libraries, and for meetings of various kinds, so that all
outlay on expensive municipal and other buildings might
be deferred until the later stages of the enterprise. Work,
too, would be practically completed in one ward before
commencing on another, and the operations in the various
wards would be taken up in due and proper sequence, so
that those portions of the town site on which building
operations were not in progress would also be a source of
revenue, either as allotments, cow-pastures, or, perhaps,
as brickfields.</p>

<p>Let us now deal with the subject immediately before
us. Will the principles on which Garden City is to be
built have any bearing on the effectiveness of its municipal
expenditure? In other words, will a given revenue yield
greater results than under ordinary conditions? These
questions will be answered in the affirmative. It will
be shown that, pound for pound, money will be more
effectively spent than elsewhere, and that there will be
many great and obvious economies which cannot be expressed
in figures with much accuracy, but which would
certainly represent in the aggregate a very large sum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>The first great economy to be noticed is that the item
of “landlord’s rent,” which, under ordinary conditions,
largely enters into municipal expenditure, will, in Garden
City, scarcely enter at all. Thus, all well-ordered towns
require administrative buildings, schools, swimming
baths, libraries, parks; and the sites which these and
other corporate undertakings occupy are usually purchased.
In such cases the money necessary for the purchase
of the sites is generally borrowed on the security
of the rates; and thus it is that a very considerable part
of the total rates levied by a municipality are ordinarily
applied, not to productive works, but either to what
we have termed “landlord’s rent,” in the shape of
interest on money borrowed to effect the purchase, or
to the provision of a sinking fund in payment of the
purchase money of the land so acquired, which is landlord’s
rent in a capitalised form.</p>

<p>Now, in Garden City, all such expenditure, with such
exceptions as road sites on the agricultural estate, has
been already provided for. Thus, the 250 acres for public
parks, the sites for schools and other public buildings,
will cost the ratepayers nothing whatever, or, to put it
more correctly, their cost, which was really £40 per acre,
has been covered, as we have seen, by the annual average
contribution of 1s. 1d. per head, which each person is
supposed to make in discharge of landlord’s rent; and
the revenue of the town, £50,000, is the <i>net</i> revenue after
all interest and sinking fund in respect of the whole site
has been deducted. In considering, therefore, the question
whether £50,000 is a sufficient revenue, it must be
remembered that in no case has any cost of municipal
sites to be first deducted from that amount.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Another item in which a great economy will be
effected will be found in a comparison between Garden
City and any old city like London. London wishes to
breathe a fuller municipal spirit, and so proceeds to construct
schools, to pull down slums, to erect libraries,
swimming baths, etc. In these cases, it has not only to
purchase the freeholds of the sites, but also has usually
to pay for the buildings which had been previously
erected thereon, and which are purchased solely, of
course, with a view to their demolition and to a clearing
of the ground, and frequently it has also to meet claims
for business-disturbance, together with heavy legal expenses
in settling claims. In this connection it may be
remarked that the inclusive cost of <i>sites</i> of schools purchased
by the London School Board since its constitution,
<i>i.e.</i>, the cost, including old buildings, business-disturbance,
law charges, etc., has already reached the enormous
sum of £3,516,072,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and the exclusive cost of the sites
(370 acres in extent) ready for building by the Board is
equal, on the average, to £9,500 per acre.</p>

<p>At this rate the cost of the 24 acres of school sites
for Garden City would be £228,000, so that another
site for a model city could be purchased out of what
would be saved in Garden City in respect of school sites
alone. “Oh, but,” it may be said, “the school sites of
Garden City are extravagantly large, and would be out
of the question in London, and it is altogether unfair to
compare a small town like Garden City with London, the
wealthy capital of a mighty Empire.” I would reply,
“It is quite true that the cost of land in London would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
make such sites extravagant, not to say prohibitive&mdash;they
would cost about £40,000,000 sterling&mdash;but does not this
of itself suggest a most serious defect of system, and that
at a most vital part? Can children be better taught
where land costs £9,500 an acre than where it costs £40?
Whatever may be the real economic value of the London
site, for other purposes&mdash;as to which we may have something
to say at a later stage&mdash;for school purposes, wherein
lies the advantage that the sites on which its schools are
built are frequently surrounded by dingy factories or
crowded courts and alleys? If Lombard Street is an
ideal place for banks, is not a park like the Central
Avenue of Garden City an ideal place for schools?&mdash;and
is not the welfare of our children the primary consideration
with any well-ordered community?” “But,” it
may be said, “the children must be educated near their
homes, and these homes must be near the places where
their parents work.” Precisely; but does not the scheme
provide for this in the most effective manner, and in that
respect also are not the school sites of Garden City
superior to those of London? The children will have to
expend less than an average amount of energy in going
to school, a matter, as all educationists admit, of immense
importance, especially in the winter. But further, have
we not heard from Professor Marshall (see heading to
<a href="#Page_38">Chapter III.</a>) that “150,000 people, in London, engaged
in the clothes-making trades, are doing work which it is
against all economic reason to have done where ground-rent
is high”&mdash;in other words, that these 150,000 people
<i>should not be in London at all</i>; and does not the consideration
that the education of the children of such
workers is carried on at once under inferior conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and at enormous cost add weight and significance to the
Professor’s words? If these workers ought not to be in
London, then their homes, for which, insanitary as they
are, they pay heavy rents, ought not to be in London; a
certain proportion of the shopkeepers who supply their
wants should not be in London; and various other
people to whom the wages earned by these persons in the
clothes-making trade give employment should not be in
London. Hence, there is a sense&mdash;and a very real one&mdash;in
which it is fair to compare the cost of school sites in
Garden City with the cost of school sites in London;
because obviously if these people do, as suggested by
Professor Marshall, migrate from London, they can at
once effect (if they make, as I have suggested, proper provision
beforehand) not only a great saving in respect of
ground-rent for their workshops, but also a vast saving
in respect of sites for homes, schools, and other purposes;
and this saving is obviously the difference between what
is now paid and what would be paid under the new conditions,
minus the loss incurred (if any), and plus the
numerous gains secured as the result of such removal.</p>

<p>Let us for the sake of clearness make the comparison
in another way. The people of London have paid a
capital sum representing, when spread over the whole
population of London (this being taken at 6,000,000),
upwards of 11s. 6d. per head of population for school sites
held by the London School Board, a sum which is, of
course, exclusive of the sites for voluntary schools. The
population of Garden City, 30,000 in number, have
entirely saved that 11s. 6d. per head, making a total
saving of £17,250, which at 3 per cent. involves an
annual saving of £517 in perpetuity. And besides thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
saving £517 a year as interest on cost of sites for schools,
Garden City has secured sites for its schools incomparably
better than those of London schools&mdash;sites which afford
ample accommodation for all the children of the town,
and not, as in the case of the London School Board,
accommodation for only half of the children of the
municipality. (The sites of the London School Board
are 370 acres in extent, or about 1 acre to every 16,000 of
the population, while the people of Garden City have
obtained 24 acres or 1 acre for every 1,250.) In other
words, Garden City secures sites which are larger, better
placed, and in every way more suitable for educational
purposes, at a mere fraction of the cost which in London
is incurred for sites vastly inferior in every respect.</p>

<p>The economies with which we have thus dealt are, it
will be seen, effected by the two simple expedients we
have referred to. First, by buying the land <i>before</i> a new
value is given to it by migration, the migrating people
obtain a site at an extremely low figure, and secure the
coming increment for themselves and those who come
after them; and secondly, by coming to a new site,
they do not have to pay large sums for old buildings, for
compensation for disturbance, and for heavy legal
charges. The practicability of securing for the poor
workers of London the first of these great advantages
appears to have been for the moment overlooked by Professor
Marshall in his article in the <i>Contemporary
Review</i>,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> for the Professor remarks “Ultimately all
would gain by the migration, <i>but most</i>” (the italics are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
my own) “<i>the landowners and the railroads connected
with the colony</i>.” Let us then adopt the expedient here
advocated of securing that the <i>landowners</i>, “<i>who ...
will gain most</i>” by a project specially designed to benefit
a class now low down in the social scale, <i>shall be those
very people themselves</i>, as members of a new municipality,
and then a strong additional inducement will be held out
to them to make a change, which nothing but the lack of
combined effort has hitherto prevented. As to the benefit
to be derived by the railways, while no doubt the building
up of the town would specially benefit the main line of
railway which passed through the estate, it is also true
that the earnings of the people would not be diminished
to the usual extent by railway freights and charges. (<i>See</i>
<a href="#Page_28">Chap. ii.</a>, also Chap. v., page <a href="#Page_60">60</a>.)</p>

<p>We now come to deal with an element of economy which
will be simply incalculable. This is to be found in the
fact that the town is definitely planned, so that the whole
question of municipal administration may be dealt with
by one far-reaching scheme. It is not by any means necessary,
and it is not, humanly speaking, possible, that the
final scheme should be the work of one mind. It will no
doubt be the work of many minds&mdash;the minds of
engineers, of architects and surveyors, of landscape
gardeners and electricians. But it is essential, as we
have said, that there should be unity of design and
purpose&mdash;that the town should be planned as a whole,
and not left to grow up in a chaotic manner as has been
the case with all English towns, and more or less so with
the towns of all countries. A town, like a flower, or a
tree, or an animal, should, at each stage of its growth,
possess unity, symmetry, completeness, and the effect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
growth should never be to destroy that unity, but to give
it greater purpose, nor to mar that symmetry, but to
make it more symmetrical; while the completeness of the
early structure should be merged in the yet greater completeness
of the later development.</p>

<p>Garden City is not only planned, but it is planned
with a view to the very latest of modern requirements;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
and it is obviously always easier, and usually far more
economical and completely satisfactory, to make out of
fresh material a new instrument than to patch up and
alter an old one. This element of economy will be
perhaps best dealt with by a concrete illustration, and
one of a very striking nature at once presents itself.</p>

<p>In London the question of building a new street
between Holborn and the Strand has been for many
years under consideration, and at length a scheme is
being carried out, imposing an enormous cost on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
people of London. “Every such change in the street
geography of London displaces thousands of the poor”&mdash;I
quote from the <i>Daily Chronicle</i> of July 6, 1898&mdash;“and
for many years all public or quasi-public schemes have
been charged with the liability to re-house as many of
them as possible. This is as it should be; but the difficulty
begins when the public is asked to face the music
and pay the bill. In the present case some three
thousand souls of the working population have to be
turned out. After some searching of heart, it is decided
that most of them are so closely tied to the spot by their
employment that it would be a hardship to send them
more than a mile away. The result, in cash, is that
London must spend in re-housing them about £100 a
head&mdash;or £300,000 in all. As to those who cannot fairly
be asked to go even a mile away&mdash;hangers-on to the
market, or others tethered to the spot&mdash;the cost will be
even higher. They will require to have parcels of the
precious land cleared by the great scheme itself, and the
result of that will be to house them at the handsome
figure of £260 a-piece, or some £1,400 for every family of
five or six. Financial statements convey little to the
ordinary mind. Let us make it a little more intelligible.
A sum of £1,400 means, in the house market, a rental of
nearly £100 a year. It would buy an excellent, in fact a
sumptuous, house and garden at Hampstead, such as the
better middle-class delight in. It would purchase anywhere
in the nearer suburbs such houses as men with
£1,000 a year inhabit. If one went further afield, to the
new neighbourhoods which the City clerk can easily reach
by rail, a £1,400 house represents actual magnificence.”
But on what scale of comfort will the poor Covent Garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
labourer with a wife and four children live? The £1,400
will by no means represent a fair standard of comfort, to
say nothing of magnificence. “He will live in three
rooms sufficiently small in a block at least three storeys
high.” Contrast this with what might be done on a new
area, by carefully planning a bold scheme at the outset.
Streets of greater width than this new street would be
laid out and constructed at a mere fraction of the cost,
while a sum of £1,400, instead of providing 1 family with
“three rooms sufficiently small in blocks at least three
storeys high,” would provide 7 families in Garden City
with a comfortable six-roomed cottage each, and with a
nice little garden; and, manufacturers being concurrently
induced to build on the sites set apart for them, each
breadwinner would be placed within easy walking
distance of his work.</p>

<p>There is another modern need which all towns and
cities should be designed to meet&mdash;a need which has
arisen with the evolution of modern sanitation, and which
has of recent years been accentuated by the rapid growth
of invention. Subways for sewerage and surface drainage,
for water, gas, telegraph and telephone wires, electric
lighting wires, wires for conveying motive power,
pneumatic tubes for postal purposes, have come to
be regarded as economic if not essential. But if
they would be a source of economy in an old city,
how much more so in new ones; for on a clean sheet it
will be easy to use the very best appliances for their construction,
and to avail ourselves to the fullest extent of
the ever-growing advantages which they possess as the
number of services which they accommodate increases.
Before the subways can be constructed, trenches some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>what
wide and deep must be excavated. In making these
the most approved excavating machinery could be employed.
In old towns this might be very objectionable,
if not, indeed, quite impossible. But here, in Garden
City, the steam navvy would not make its appearance in
the parts where people were living, but where they were
coming to live after its work in preparing the way had
been completed. What a grand thing it would be if the
people of England could, by an actual illustration under
their very eyes, be convinced that machinery can be so
used as to confer not only an ultimate national benefit,
but a direct and immediate advantage, and that not only
upon those who actually own it or use it, but on others
who are given work by its magic aid. What a happy day
it would be for the people of this country, and of all
countries, if they could learn, from practical experience,
that machinery can be used on an extended scale to <i>give</i>
employment as well as <i>to take it away</i>&mdash;to <i>implace</i> labour
as well as to <i>displace</i> it&mdash;to free men as well as to <i>enslave</i>
them. There will be plenty of work to be done in Garden
City. That is obvious. It is also obvious that, until a
large number of houses and factories are built, many of
these things cannot be done, and that the faster the
trenches are dug, the subways finished, the factories and
the houses built, and the light and the power turned on,
the sooner can this town, the home of an industrious and
a happy people, be built, and the sooner can others start
the work of building other towns, not like it, but
gradually becoming as much superior to it as our present
locomotives are to the first crude attempts of the pioneers
of mechanical traction.</p>

<p>We have now shown four cogent reasons why a given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
revenue should, in Garden City, yield vastly greater
results than under ordinary conditions.</p>

<p>(1) That no “landlord’s rent” or interest in respect
of freeholds would be payable other than the small
amount which has been already provided for in estimating
net revenue.</p>

<p>(2) That the site being practically clear of buildings
and other works, but little expenditure would be incurred
in the purchase of such buildings, or compensation for
business-disturbance, or legal and other expenses in connection
therewith.</p>

<p>(3) The economy arising out of a definite plan, and
one in accordance with modern needs and requirements,
thus saving those items of expenditure which are incurred
in old cities as it is sought to bring them into harmony
with modern ideas.</p>

<p>(4) The possibility, as the whole site will be clear for
operations, of introducing machinery of the very best and
most modern type in road-making and other engineering
operations.</p>

<p>There are other economies which will become apparent
to the reader as he proceeds, but, having cleared the
ground by discussing general principles, we shall be
better prepared to discuss the question as to the sufficiency
of our estimates in another chapter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<span class="smaller">FURTHER DETAILS OF EXPENDITURE ON GARDEN CITY.</span></h2>


<p>To make this chapter interesting to the general reader
would be difficult, perhaps impossible; but if carefully
studied, it will, I think, be found to abundantly establish
one of the main propositions of this book&mdash;that the rate-rent
of a well-planned town, built on an agricultural
estate, will amply suffice for the creation and maintenance
of such municipal undertakings as are usually provided
for out of rates compulsorily levied.</p>

<p>The net available revenue of Garden City, after payment
of interest on debentures and providing a sinking
fund for the landed estate, has been already estimated at
£50,000 per annum (see Chap. iii., page <a href="#Page_42">42</a>). Having, in
the fourth chapter, given special reasons why a given
expenditure in Garden City would be unusually productive,
I will now enter into fuller details, so that any
criticism which this book may elicit, having something
tangible to deal with, may be the more valuable in preparing
the ground for an experiment such as is here
advocated.</p>

</table></div>
<p>Besides the above expenditure, a considerable outlay
would be incurred in respect of markets, water supply,
lighting, tramways, and other revenue-yielding undertakings.
But these items of expenditure are almost invariably
attended with considerable profits, which go in
aid of rates. No calculation, therefore, need be made in
respect of these.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>I will now deal separately with most of the items in
the above estimate.</p>


<h3><i>A. Roads and Streets.</i></h3>

<p>The first point to be observed under this head is that
the cost of making new streets to meet the growth of
population is generally not borne by the ground landlord
nor defrayed out of the rates. It is usually paid by the
building-owner before the local authorities will consent
to take the road over as a free gift. It is obvious, therefore,
that the greater part of the £100,000 <i>might</i> be
struck out. Experts will also not forget that the cost of
the road sites is elsewhere provided for. In considering
the question of the actual sufficiency of the estimate,
they will also remember that of the boulevards one-half
and of the streets and avenues one-third may
be regarded as in the nature of park, and the cost
of laying out and maintenance of these portions of
the roads is dealt with under the head “Parks.”
They will also note that road-making materials would
probably be found near at hand, and that, the railway
relieving the streets of most of the heavy traffic, the
more expensive methods of paving need not be resorted
to. The cost, £4,000 per mile, would, however, be doubtless
inadequate if subways are constructed, as probably
they ought to be. The following consideration, however,
has led me not to estimate for these. Subways are, where
useful, a source of economy. The cost of maintaining
roads is lessened, as the continual breaking-up for laying
and repairing of water, gas, and electric mains is avoided,
while any waste from leaky pipes is quickly detected, and
thus the subways <i>pay</i>. Their cost should, therefore, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
debited rather to cost of water, gas, and electric supplies,
and these services are almost invariably a source of
revenue to the Company or Corporation which constructs
them.</p>


<h3><i>B. Country Roads.</i></h3>

<p>These roads are only 40 feet wide, and £1,200 a mile is
ample. The cost of sites has in this case to be defrayed
out of estimate.</p>


<h3><i>C. Circular Railway and Bridges.</i></h3>

<p>The cost of site is elsewhere provided for (<i>see</i> p. <a href="#Page_40">40</a>).
The cost of maintenance does not, of course, include working
expenses, locomotives, etc. To cover these a charge
based on cost might be made to traders using the line. It
should also be noticed that, as in the case of roads, by
showing that the expense of this undertaking could be
defrayed out of the rate-rent, I am proving more than I
undertook to prove. I am proving that the rate-rent is
sufficient to provide for landlords’ rent, for such purposes
as are usually defrayed out of rent, <i>and also for greatly
extending the area of municipal activity</i>.</p>

<p>It may here be well to point out that this circle railway
not only will save the trader the expense of carting
to and from his warehouse or factory, but will enable him
to claim a rebate from the railway company. Section 4
of the Railway and Canal Tariff Act, 1894, enacts:
“Whenever merchandise is received or delivered by a
railway company at any siding or branch railway not
belonging to the company, and a dispute arises between
the railway company and the consignor or consignee of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
such merchandise, as to any allowance or rebate from the
rates charged to such consignor or consignee, in respect
that the railway company does not provide station accommodation
or perform terminal services, the Railway and
Canal Commissioners shall have jurisdiction to hear and
determine what, if any, is a just and reasonable allowance
or rebate.”</p>


<h3><i>D. Schools.</i></h3>

<p>This estimate of £12 per school place represents what
was only a few years ago (1892) the average cost per child
of the London School Board for building, architect, and
clerk of the works, and for furniture and fittings; and
no one can doubt that buildings greatly superior to those
in London could be obtained for this sum. The saving in
sites has been already dealt with, but it may be remarked
that in London the cost per child for sites has been
£6 11s 10d.</p>

<p>As showing how ample this estimate is, it may be
observed that the cost of schools which have been
proposed to be built by a private company at Eastbourne,
“with a view of keeping out the School Board,” is estimated
at £2,500 for 400 places, or but little more than
half the sum per school place provided in the estimate for
Garden City.</p>

<p>The cost of maintenance, £3 per head, is probably
sufficient, in view of the fact that the “expenditure per
scholar in actual average attendance” in England and
Wales, as given in the Report of the Committee of Council
on Education, 1896-97, c. 8545, is £2 11s. 11&frac12;d. It must
be especially noticed, too, that the whole cost of educa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>tion
is, in these estimates, assumed to be borne by Garden
City, though a considerable part would be, in the ordinary
course, borne by the National Exchequer. The
amount of income per scholar in actual average attendance
in England and Wales, as given in the same report,
is £1 1s. 2d. as against a rate in Garden City of £3. So
that I am again, in the case of the schools, as in the case
of roads and circle railway, proving more than I set out
to prove.</p>


<h3><i>E. Town Hall and Expenses of Management.</i></h3>

<p>It is to be noticed that the estimates of the various
undertakings are intended to cover professional direction
and supervision of architects, engineers, teachers, etc.
The £2,000 for maintenance and working expenses under
this head is, therefore, intended to include only the
salaries of town clerk and of officials other than those
comprised under special heads, together with incidental
expenses.</p>


<h3><i>F. Library, and G. Museum.</i></h3>

<p>The latter is usually and the former not infrequently
elsewhere provided for out of funds other than rates. So,
here again, I am more than proving my case.</p>


<h3><i>H. Parks and Road Ornamentation.</i></h3>

<p>This item of cost would not be incurred until the
undertaking was in a thoroughly sound financial condition,
and the park space for a considerable period might
be a source of revenue as agricultural land. Further,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
much of the park space would probably be left in a state
of nature. Forty acres of this park space is road ornamentation,
but the planting of trees and shrubs would
not entail great expense. Again, a considerable part of
the area would be reserved for cricket-fields, lawn-tennis
courts, and other playgrounds, and the clubs using
public grounds might perhaps be called upon to contribute
to the expense of keeping these in order, as is
customary elsewhere.</p>


<h3><i>I. Sewage.</i></h3>

<p>All that need be said on this subject has been said in
Chap. i., page <a href="#Page_25">25</a>, and Chap. ii., page <a href="#Page_32">32</a>.</p>


<h3><i>K. Interest.</i></h3>

<p>The money to construct the public works with which
we have been dealing is supposed to be borrowed at 4&frac12;
per cent. The question here arises&mdash;a question partly
dealt with in <a href="#Page_43">Chap. iv.</a>&mdash;what is the security for those
who lend money on the “B” debentures?</p>

<p>My answer is three-fold.</p>

<p>(1) Those who advance money to effect any improvements
on land have a security the safety of which is in
reality largely determined by the effectiveness with which
the money so advanced is spent; and, applying this
truism, I venture to say that, for effectiveness of expenditure,
no money which the investing public has been for
many years asked to subscribe for improvements of a like
nature has an equal security, whether it be measured by
miles of road, acres of park, or numbers of school children
well provided for.</p>

<p>(2) Those who advance money to effect improvements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
on land have a security the safety of which is largely
determined by the consideration, aye or no, are other and
yet more valuable works to be simultaneously carried out
by others at their own expense, which other works are to
become a security in respect of the first-mentioned advance;
and, applying this second truism, I say that, as
the money for effecting the public improvements here
described would only be asked for as and when other
improvements&mdash;factories, houses, shops, etc. (costing far
more money than the public works necessary at any given
period)&mdash;were about to be built or were in process of
building, the quality of the security would be a very
high one.</p>

<p>(3) It is difficult to name a better security than that
offered when money is to be expended in converting an
agricultural estate into an urban, and this of the very
best known type.</p>

<p>That the scheme is in reality a 3 per cent. security,
and would in its later stages become so, I entertain
little doubt; but I do not forget that, though its
points of novelty are the very elements which really <i>make</i>
it secure, they may not make it <i>seem</i> so, and that those who
are merely looking out for an investment may eye it with
some distrust because of its novelty. We shall have in
the first instance to look to those who will advance money
with somewhat mixed motives&mdash;public spirit, love of
enterprise, and possibly, as to some persons, with a
lurking belief that they will be able to dispose of their
debentures at a premium, as they probably will. Therefore,
I put down 4&frac12; per cent., but if anyone’s conscience
prick him he may tender at 2 or 2&frac12;, or may even advance
money without interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>L. Sinking Fund.</i></h3>

<p>This sinking fund, which provides for the extinction
of the debt in thirty years, compares most favourably with
that usually provided by local bodies for works of so permanent
a character. The Local Government Board frequently
allows loans to be created with a sinking fund
extending over much longer periods. It is to be remembered
also that an additional sinking fund for the landed
estate has been already provided (<i>see</i> Chapter iv., p. <a href="#Page_42">42</a>).</p>


<h3><i>M. Balance available for Rates levied by Local Bodies
within whose jurisdiction the estate is situated.</i></h3>

<p>It will be seen that the whole scheme of Garden City
will make extremely few demands upon the resources of
outside local authorities. Roads, sewers, schools, parks,
libraries, etc., will be provided out of the funds of the
new “municipality,” and in this way the whole scheme
will come to the agriculturists at present on the estate
very much like “a rate in aid”; for, as rates are only
raised for the purpose of public expenditure, it follows
that, there being little or no fresh call upon the rates
while the number of ratepayers is greatly increased, the
rate per head must fall. I do not, however, forget that
there are some functions which such a voluntary organisation
as Garden City could not take over, such as the
police and the administration of the poor-law. As to the
latter, it is believed that the whole scheme will in the
long run make such rates unnecessary, as Garden City will
provide, at all events from the time when the estate has
been fully paid for, pensions for all its needy old citizens.
Meantime and from the very outset it is doing its full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
share of charitable work. It has allotted sites of 30 acres
for various institutions, and at a later stage will doubtless
be prepared to assume the whole cost of maintaining
them.</p>

<p>With regard to police rates, it is not believed that
these can be largely increased by the coming into the town
of 30,000 citizens, who, for the most part, will be of the
law-abiding class; for, there being but one landlord, and
this the community, it will not be difficult to prevent
the creation of those surroundings which make the intervention
of the police so frequently necessary. (<i>See</i>
<a href="#Page_76">Chapter vii.</a>)</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have, I think, now fully established my contention
that the rate-rent which would be willingly offered by the
tenants of Garden City, in respect of the advantages
afforded them, would be amply sufficient, (1) to pay landlord’s
rent in the form of interest on debentures; (2) to
provide a sinking fund for the entire abolition of landlord’s
rent; and (3) to provide for the municipal needs of
the town without recourse to any Act of Parliament for
the enforcement of rates&mdash;the community depending
solely on the very large powers it possesses as a landlord.</p>


<h3><i>N. Revenue-bearing Expenditure.</i></h3>

<p>If the conclusion already arrived at&mdash;that the experiment
advocated affords an outlet for an extremely effective
expenditure of labour and capital&mdash;is sound in
regard to objects the cost of which is usually defrayed
out of rates, that conclusion must, I think, be equally
sound in regard to tramways, lighting, water-supply, and
the like, which, when carried on by municipalities, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
usually made a source of revenue, thus relieving the rate-payer
by making his rates lighter.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> And as I have added
nothing to the proposed revenue for any prospective
profits on such undertakings, I do not propose to make
any estimate of expenditure.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>



<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<span class="smaller">ADMINISTRATION.</span></h2>


<p>I have in the 4th and 5th chapters dealt with the fund
at the disposal of the Board of Management, and have
endeavoured to show, and I believe with success, that the
rate-rents collected by the trustees in their capacity of
landlords of the towns will suffice, (1) to provide interest
on the debentures with which the estate is purchased,
(2) to provide a sinking fund which will at a comparatively
early date leave the community free from the
burden of interest on such debentures, and (3) to enable
the Board of Management to carry on such undertakings
as are elsewhere, for the most part, carried out by means
of rates compulsorily levied.</p>

<p>A most important question now arises regarding the
extent to which municipal enterprise is to be carried, and
how far it is to supersede private enterprise. We have
already by implication stated that the experiment advocated
does not involve, as has been the case in so many
social experiments&mdash;the complete municipalisation of industry
and the elimination of private enterprise. But
what principle is to guide us in determining the line
which shall separate municipal from private control and
management? Mr. Joseph Chamberlain has said: “The
true field for municipal activity is limited to those things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
which the community can do better than the individual.”
Precisely, but that is a truism, and does not carry us one
whit further, for the very question at issue is as to <i>what
those things are</i> which the community can do better than
the individual; and when we seek for an answer to this
question we find two directly conflicting views&mdash;the view
of the socialist, who says: Every phase of wealth-production
and distribution can be best performed by the community;
and the view of the individualist, who contends
these things are best left to the individual. But probably
the true answer is to be found at neither extreme, is only
to be gained by experiment, and will differ in different
communities and at different periods. With a growing
intelligence and honesty in municipal enterprise, with
greater freedom from the control of the Central Government,
it may be found&mdash;especially on municipally-owned
land&mdash;that the field of municipal activity may grow so as
to embrace a very large area, and yet the municipality
claim no rigid monopoly and the fullest rights of combination
exist.</p>

<p>Bearing this in mind, the municipality of Garden City
will, at the outset, exercise great caution, and not attempt
too much. The difficulty of raising the necessary funds
with which to carry on municipal undertakings would be
greatly increased if the Board of Management attempted
to do everything; and, in the prospectus to be ultimately
issued, a clear statement will be made of what the Corporation
undertakes to do with the moneys entrusted to
it, and this will at first embrace little more than those
things which experience has proved municipalities can
perform better than individuals. Tenants, too, will, it is
obvious, be far more ready to offer adequate “rate-rents”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
if they are given distinctly to understand to what purpose
those “rate-rents” are to be devoted, and after those
things are done, and done well, little difficulty will be
placed in the way of further appropriate extensions of
the field of municipal enterprise.</p>

<p>Our answer, then, to the question, what field is to be
covered by municipal enterprise, is this. Its extent will
be measured simply by the willingness of the tenants to
pay rate-rents, and will grow in proportion as municipal
work is done efficiently and honestly, or decline as it is
done dishonestly or inefficiently. If, for example, the
tenants find that a very small additional contribution,
recently made in the shape of “rate-rent,” has enabled
the authorities to provide an excellent supply of water for
all purposes, and they are convinced that so good a result
at so small a cost would not have been achieved through
the agency of any private undertaking working for a
profit, they will naturally be willing and even anxious
that further hopeful-looking experiments in municipal
work should be undertaken. The site of Garden City
may, in this respect, be compared with Mr. and Mrs.
Boffin’s famous apartment, which, the reader of Dickens
will remember, was furnished at one end to suit the taste
of Mrs. Boffin, who was “a dab at fashion,” while at the
other end it was furnished to conform to the notions of
solid comfort which so gratified Mr. Boffin, but with the
mutual understanding between the parties that if Mr. B.
should get by degrees to be “a high-flyer” at fashion,
then Mrs. B.’s carpet would gradually “come for’arder,”
whilst if Mrs. B. should become “less of a dab at
fashion,” Mrs. B.’s carpet would “go back’arder.” So,
in Garden City, if the inhabitants become greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
“dabs” at co-operation, the municipality will “come
for’arder”; if they become less “dabs” at co-operation,
the municipality will “go back’arder”; while the
relative number of positions occupied by municipal
workers and non-municipal workers at any period will
very fairly reflect the skill and integrity of the public
administration and the degree of value which is therefore
associated with municipal effort.</p>

<p>But the municipality of Garden City, besides setting
its face against any attempt to embark upon too large a
field of enterprise, will so frame its constitution that the
responsibility for each branch of the municipal service
will be thrown directly upon the officers of that branch
and not be practically lost sight of because loosely thrown
upon the larger central body&mdash;a plan which makes it
difficult for the public to perceive where any leakage or
friction may be taking place. The constitution is
modelled upon that of a large and well-appointed business,
which is divided into various departments, each
department being expected to justify its own continued
existence&mdash;its officers being selected, not so much for their
knowledge of the business generally as for their special
fitness for the work of their department.</p>


<h3>THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT</h3>

<p>consists <span class="lock">of&mdash;</span></p>

<ul><li>(1) The Central Council.</li>

<li>(2) The Departments.</li></ul>


<h3>THE CENTRAL COUNCIL (<i>see</i> <a href="#Diagram_5">Diagram 5</a>).</h3>

<p>In this council (or its nominees) are vested the rights
and powers of the community as sole landlord of Garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
City. Into its treasury are paid (after provision has been
made for landlord’s rent and sinking fund) all rate-rents
received from its tenants, as well as the profits derived
from its various municipal undertakings, and these, we
have seen, are amply sufficient to discharge all public
burdens without any resort to the expedient of compulsory
rates. The powers possessed by the Central
Council are, it may be noticed in passing, more ample
than those possessed by other municipal bodies, for whilst
most of these enjoy only such powers as are expressly conferred
on them by Acts of Parliament, the Central
Council of Garden City exercises on behalf of the people
those wider rights, powers and privileges which are enjoyed
by landlords under the common law. The private
owner of land can do with his land and with the revenue
he derives from it what he pleases so long as he is not a
nuisance to his neighbour; while, on the other hand,
public bodies which acquire land or obtain power to levy
rates by Acts of Parliament, can only use that land or
spend those rates for such purposes as are expressly prescribed
by those Acts. But Garden City is in a greatly
superior position, for, by stepping as a <i>quasi</i> public body
into the rights of a private landlord, it becomes at once
clothed with far larger powers for carrying out the will
of the people than are possessed by other local bodies,
and thus solves to a large extent the problem of local self-government.</p>

<p>But the Central Council, though possessing these large
powers, delegates many of them, for convenience of administration,
to its various departments, retaining, however,
responsibility <span class="lock">for&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) The general plan on which the estate is laid out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) The amount of money voted to each of the various
spending departments, as schools, roads, parks, etc.</p>

<p>(3) Such measure of oversight and control of the departments
as is necessary to preserve a general unity and
harmony, but no more.</p>


<h3>THE DEPARTMENTS.</h3>

<p>These are divided into various groups&mdash;for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>(A) Public Control.</li>
<li>(B) Engineering.</li>
<li>(C) Social Purposes.</li>
</ul>



<h4>GROUP A, PUBLIC CONTROL.</h4>

<p>This group may consist of the following sub-groups:</p>

<ul>
<li>Finance.</li>
<li>Assessment.</li>
<li>Law.</li>
<li>Inspection.</li>
</ul>



<h5><i>Finance.</i></h5>

<p>Into this department are paid, after making provision
for landlord’s rent and sinking fund, all rate-rents; and
out of it the necessary sums for the various departments
are voted by the Central Council.</p>


<h5><i>Assessment.</i></h5>

<p>This department receives all applications from would-be
tenants, and fixes the rate-rent to be paid&mdash;such rate-rents
not, however, being fixed arbitrarily by the department,
but upon the essential principle adopted by other
Assessment Committees&mdash;the really determining factor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
being the rate-rent which an average tenant is found
willing to pay.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>


<h5><i>Law.</i></h5>

<p>This department settles the terms and conditions
under which leases shall be granted, and the nature of
the covenants to be entered into by and with the Central
Council.</p>


<h5><i>Inspection.</i></h5>

<p>This department carries out such reasonable duties in
relation to inspection as the municipality, in its capacity
of landlord, may with the tenants of the municipality
mutually agree upon.</p>


<h4>GROUP B, ENGINEERING.</h4>

<p>This group may consist of the following departments&mdash;some
of which would be later creations.</p>

<ul>
<li>Roads.</li>
<li>Subways.</li>
<li>Sewers.</li>
<li>Tramways.</li>
<li>Municipal Railway.</li>
<li>Public Buildings (other than schools).</li>
<li>Park and open spaces.</li>
<li>Drainage.</li>
<li>Canals.</li>
<li>Irrigation.</li>
<li>Water-supply.</li>
<li>Motive-power &amp; Lighting.</li>
<li>Messages.</li>
</ul>



<h4>GROUP C, SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL.</h4>

<p>This group is also divided into various departments,
dealing with:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Education.</li>
<li>Libraries.</li>
<li>Baths and Wash-houses.</li>
<li>Music.</li>
<li>Recreation.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Election of Members of Board of Management.</i></h3>

<p>Members (who may be men or women) are elected by
the rate-renters to serve on one or more departments, and
the Chairmen and Vice-Chairmen of the departments
constitute the Central Council.</p>

<p>Under such a constitution it is believed that the community
would have the readiest means of rightly estimating
the work of its servants, and, at election times, would
have clear and distinct issues brought before it. The
candidates would not be expected to specify their views
upon a hundred and one questions of municipal policy
upon which they had no definite opinions, and which
would probably not give rise within their term of office
to the necessity for recording their votes, but would
simply state their views as to some special question or
group of questions, a sound opinion upon which would be
of urgent importance to the electors, because immediately
connected with the welfare of the town.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<span class="smaller">SEMI-MUNICIPAL ENTERPRISE&mdash;LOCAL OPTION&mdash;TEMPERANCE
REFORM.</span></h2>


<p>In the last chapter we saw that no line could be sharply
drawn between municipal and individual enterprise, so
that one could definitely say of one or the other,
“Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further”; and this
ever-changing character of the problem can be usefully
illustrated in our examination of the industrial life of
Garden City by reference to a form of enterprise there
carried on which is neither distinctly municipal nor distinctly
individualistic, but partaking, as it does, of the
character of both, may be termed “semi-municipal.”</p>

<p>Among the most reliable sources of revenue possessed
by many of our existing municipalities are their so-called
“public markets.” But it is important to notice that
these markets are by no means public in the same full
sense as are our public parks, libraries, water undertakings,
or those numerous other branches of municipal
work which are carried on upon public property, by
public officials, at the public expense, and solely with a
view to the public advantage. On the contrary, our so-called
“public markets” are, for the most part, carried on
by private individuals, who pay tolls for the parts of the
buildings which they occupy, but who are not, except on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
a few points, controlled by the municipality, and whose
profits are personally enjoyed by the various dealers.
Markets may, therefore, be fitly termed <i>semi-municipal</i>
enterprises.</p>

<p>It would, however, have been scarcely necessary to
touch on this question, but that it naturally leads up to
the consideration of a form of semi-municipal enterprise
which is one of the characteristic features of Garden City.
This is to be found in the Crystal Palace, which, it will
be remembered, is a wide arcade, skirting the Central
Park, in which the most attractive wares on sale in
Garden City are exhibited, and, this being a winter
garden as well as the great shopping centre, is one of the
most favourite resorts of the townspeople. The business
at the shops is carried on, not by the municipality, but
by various individuals and societies, the number of
traders being, however, limited by the principle of local
option.</p>

<p>The considerations which have led to this system
arise out of the distinction between the cases on the one
hand of the manufacturers, and on the other of the distributive
societies and shopkeepers who are invited to the
town. Thus, for example:&mdash;In the case of the manufacturer,
say, of boots, though he may be glad of the
custom of the people of the town, he is by no means
dependent on it; his products go all over the world;
and he would scarcely wish that the number of boot
manufacturers within the area should be specially
limited. He would, in fact, lose more than he would
gain by restrictions of this kind. A manufacturer frequently
prefers to have others carrying on the same
trade in his vicinity; for this gives him a larger choice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of skilled workmen or workwomen, who themselves desire
it also, because it gives them a larger range of employers.</p>

<p>But in the case of shops and stores the case is entirely
different. An individual or a society proposing to open
in Garden City, say a drapery store, would be most
anxious to know what, if any, arrangements were to be
made for limiting the number of his competitors, for he
would depend almost entirely on the trade of the town
or neighbourhood. Indeed it frequently happens that a
private landlord, when laying out a building estate,
makes arrangements with his shopkeeping tenants
designed to prevent them from being swamped by others
in the same trade starting on his estate.</p>

<p>The problem, therefore, seems to be how to make such
suitable arrangements as will at <span class="lock">once&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(1) Induce tenants of the shopkeeping class to come
and start in business, offering to the community
adequate rate-rents.</p>

<p>(2) Prevent the absurd and wasteful multiplication of
shops referred to in the note at the foot of page <a href="#Page_81">81</a>.</p>

<p>(3) Secure the advantages usually gained (or supposed
to be) by competition&mdash;such as low prices, wide
range of choice, fair dealing, civility, etc.</p>

<p>(4) Avoid the evils attending monopoly.</p></div>

<p>All these results may be secured by a simple expedient,
which will have the effect of converting competition
from an active into a latent force to be brought
into play or held in reserve. It is, as we have said, an
application of the principle of local option. To explain:&mdash;Garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
City is the sole landlord, and it can grant to a
proposed tenant&mdash;we will suppose a co-operative society
or an individual trader in drapery or fancy goods&mdash;a
long lease of a certain amount of space in the Grand
Arcade (Crystal Palace), at a certain annual rate-rent;
and it can say, in effect, to its tenant, “That site is the
only space in that ward which we for the present intend
to let to any tenant engaged in your trade. The Arcade
is, however, designed to be not only the great shopping
centre of the town and district, and the permanent exhibition
in which the manufacturers of the town display
their wares, but a summer and winter garden. The
space this Arcade covers will, therefore, be considerably
greater than is actually required for the purposes of shops
or stores, if these are kept within reasonable limits.
Now, so long as you give satisfaction to the people of the
town, none of the space devoted to these recreative
purposes will be let to anyone engaged in your calling.
It is necessary, however, to guard against monopoly. If,
therefore, the people become dissatisfied with your
methods of trading, and desire that the force of competition
shall be actively brought into play against you, then,
on the requisition of a certain number, the necessary
space in the Arcade will be allotted by the municipality
to some one desirous of starting an opposition store.”</p>

<p>Under this arrangement it will be seen the trader will
depend upon the good-will of his customers. If he charges
prices which are too high; if he misrepresents the quality
of his goods; if he does not treat his employees with proper
consideration in regard to hours of labour, wages, or other
matters, he will run a great risk of losing the good-will of
his customers, and the people of the town will have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
method of expressing their sentiments regarding him
which will be extremely powerful; they will simply invite
a new competitor to enter the field. But, on the other
hand, as long as he perform his functions wisely and well,
his good-will resting on the solid basis of the good-will of
his customers, he will be protected. His advantages are,
therefore, enormous. In other towns a competitor might
enter the field against him at any moment without
warning, perhaps at the very time when he had purchased
some expensive goods, which, unless sold during the
season, could only be realised at an enormous sacrifice.
In Garden City, on the other hand, he has full notice of
his danger&mdash;time to prepare for it and even to avert it.
Besides, the members of the community, except for
the purpose of bringing a trader to reason, will not
only have no interest in bringing a competitor into
the field, but their interests will be best served by
keeping competition in the background as long as
possible. If the fire of competition is brought to
bear upon a trader, they must suffer with him.
They will lose space they would far rather see devoted to
some other purpose&mdash;they will be bound to pay higher
prices than those at which the first trader could supply
them if he would, and they will have to render municipal
services to two traders instead of to one, while the two
competitors could not afford to pay so large a sum in rate-rent
as could the original trader. For in many cases the
effect of competition is to make a rise in price absolutely
necessary. Thus, A. has a trade of 100 gallons of milk a
day, and can, we will suppose, pay his expenses, earn a
bare living, and supply his customers with milk,
say, at 4d. a quart. But if a competitor enters the field,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
then A. can only sell <i>milk and water</i> at 4d. a quart if he
is to continue to pay his way. Thus the competition of
shopkeepers absolutely tends not only to ruin the competitors,
but to maintain and even to raise prices, and so
to lower real wages.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Under this system of local option it will be seen that
the tradesmen of the town&mdash;be they co-operative societies
or individuals&mdash;would become, if not strictly or technically
so, yet in a very real sense, municipal servants. But
they would not be bound up in the red-tape of officialism,
and would have the fullest rights and powers of initiation.
It would not be by any literal conformity to cast-iron
and inflexible rules, but by their skill and judgment
in forecasting the wishes and in anticipating the tastes of
their constituents, as well as by their integrity and
courtesy as business men and women, that they would
win and maintain their good-will. They would run
certain risks, as all tradesmen must, and in return they
would be paid, not of course in the form of salary, but
in profits. But the risks they would run would be far
less than they must be where competition is unchecked
and uncontrolled, while their annual profits in propor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>tion
to capital invested might also be greater. They
might even sell considerably below the ordinary rate prevailing
elsewhere, but yet, having an assured trade and
being able very accurately to gauge demand, they might
turn their money over with remarkable frequency.
Their working expenses, too, would be absurdly small.
They would not have to advertise for customers, though
they would doubtless make announcements to them of
any novelties; but all that waste of effort and of money
which is so frequently expended by tradesmen in order
to secure customers or to prevent their going elsewhere,
would be quite unnecessary.</p>

<p>And not only would each trader be in a sense a municipal
servant, but those in his employ would be also. It
is true such a trader would have the fullest right
to engage and dismiss his servants; but if he acted
arbitrarily or harshly, if he paid insufficient wages, or
treated his employees inconsiderately, he would certainly
run the risk of losing the good-will of the majority of his
customers, even although in other respects he might prove
himself an admirable public servant. On the other hand,
if the example were set of profit-sharing, this might grow
into a custom, and the distinction between master and
servant would be gradually lost in the simple process of
all becoming co-operators.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>This system of local option as applied to shopkeeping
is not only business-like, but it affords an opportunity for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the expression of that public conscience against the
sweater which is now being stirred, but which scarcely
knows how to effectually respond to the new impulse.
Thus there was established in London some years ago the
Consumers’ League, the object of which was not, as its
name might lead one to suspect, to protect the consuming
public against the unscrupulous producer, but it was to
protect the sweated, over-driven producer against a consuming
public over-clamorous for cheapness. Its aim was
to assist such of the public as hate and detest the sweating
system to avail themselves of the League’s carefully
compiled information, so that they might be able to
studiously avoid the products which had passed through
sweaters’ hands. But such a movement as the Consumers’
League advocated could make but little headway without
the support of the shopkeeper. That consumer must be
an uncommonly earnest opponent of sweating who insists
upon knowing the source whence every article he purchases
has come, and a shopkeeper under ordinary circumstances
would scarcely be disposed either to give such
information or to guarantee that the goods he sold were
produced under “fair” conditions; while to establish
shops in large cities, which are already overcrowded with
distributive agencies, and to do this with the special
object of putting down sweating, is to court failure.
Here in Garden City, however, there will be a splendid
opportunity for the public conscience to express itself in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
this regard, and no shopkeeper will, I hope, venture to
sell “sweated goods.”</p>

<p>There is another question with which the term “local
option” is most closely associated which may be dealt
with here. I refer to the temperance question. Now it
will be noticed that the municipality, in its position of
sole landlord, has the <i>power</i> of dealing in the most drastic
manner possible with the liquor traffic. There are, as is
well known, many landlords who will not permit a public-house
to be opened on their estate, and the landlord of
Garden City&mdash;the people themselves&mdash;<i>could</i> adopt this
course. But would this be wise? I think not. First,
such a restriction would keep away the very large and
increasing class of moderate drinkers, and would
also keep away many of those who are scarcely
moderate in their use of alcohol, but as to whom
reformers would be most anxious that they should
be brought under the healthful influences which would
surround them in Garden City. The public-house,
or its equivalent, would, in such a community, have many
competitors for the favour of the people; while, in large
cities, with few opportunities of cheap and rational enjoyment,
it has its own way. The experiment, as one in
the direction of temperance reform, would, therefore, be
more valuable if the traffic were permitted under reasonable
regulations than if it were stopped; because, while,
in the former case, the effects in the direction of temperance
would be clearly traceable to the more natural and
healthy form of life, if the latter course were adopted it
could only prove, what no one now denies, that it may
be possible, by restrictive measures, to entirely keep away
the traffic from one small area while intensifying the
evils elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>But the community would certainly take care to
prevent the undue multiplication of licensed houses, and
it would be free to adopt any one of the various methods
which the more moderate of temperance reformers
suggest. The municipal authorities might conduct the
liquor traffic themselves, and employ the profits in relief
of rates. There is, however, much force in the objection
that it is not desirable that the revenue of a community
should be so derived, and, therefore, it might be better
that the profits should be entirely applied to purposes
which would compete with the traffic, or in minimising
its evil effects by establishing asylums for those affected
with alcoholism.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> On this subject, as on all points involved,
I earnestly invite correspondence from those who
have practical suggestions to offer; and, although the
town is but a small one, it would perhaps not be impracticable
to test various promising suggestions in the
different wards.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>



<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<span class="smaller">PRO-MUNICIPAL WORK.</span></h2>


<p>There will be found in every progressive community
societies and organisations which represent a far higher
level of public spirit and enterprise than that possessed
or displayed by such communities in their collective
capacity. It is probable that the government of a community
can never reach a higher tone or work on a higher
plane than the average sense of that community demands
and enforces; and it will greatly conduce to the well-being
of any society if the efforts of its State or municipal
organisations are inspired and quickened by those
of its members whose ideals of society duty rise higher
than the average.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>And so it may be in Garden City. There will be discovered
many opportunities for public service which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
neither the community as a whole, nor even a majority of
its members, will at first recognise the importance of, or
see their way to embrace, and which public services it
would be useless, therefore, to expect the municipality to
undertake; but those who have the welfare of society at
heart will, in the free air of the city, be always able to
experiment on their own responsibility, and thus quicken
the public conscience and enlarge the public understanding.</p>

<p>The whole of the experiment which this book describes
is indeed of this character. It represents pioneer work,
which will be carried out by those who have not a merely
pious opinion, but an effective belief in the economic,
sanitary, and social advantages of common ownership of
land, and who, therefore, are not satisfied merely to
advocate that those advantages should be secured on the
largest scale at the national expense, but are impelled to
give their views shape and form as soon as they can see
their way to join with a sufficient number of kindred
spirits. And what the whole experiment is to the nation,
so may what we term “pro-municipal” undertakings be
to the community of Garden City or to society generally.
Just as the larger experiment is designed to lead the
nation into a juster and better system of land tenure and
a better and more common-sense view of how towns
should be built, so are the various pro-municipal undertakings
of Garden City devised by those who are prepared
to lead the way in enterprises designed to further the
well-being of the town, but who have not as yet succeeded
in getting their plans or schemes adopted by the Central
Council.</p>

<p>Philanthropic and charitable institutions, religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
societies, and educational agencies of various kinds occupy
a very large part in this group of pro-municipal or pro-national
agencies, and these have been already referred
to, and their nature and purposes are well known. But
institutions which aim at the more strictly material side
of well-being, such as banks and building societies, may
be found here too. Just as the founders of the Penny
Bank paved the way for the Post Office Savings Bank, so
may some of those who study carefully the experiment of
building up Garden City see how useful a bank might be,
which, like the Penny Bank, aims not so much at gain
for its founders as at the well-being of the community at
large. Such a bank might arrange to pay the whole of
its net profits or all its profits over a certain fixed rate,
into the municipal exchequer, and give to the authorities
of the town the option of taking it over should they be
convinced of its utility and its general soundness.</p>

<p>There is another large field for pro-municipal
activity in the work of building homes for the
people. The municipality would be attempting too
much if it essayed this task, at least at the outset.
To do so would be perhaps to depart too widely
from the path which experience has justified, however
much might be said in favour of such a course on
the part of a municipal body in command of ample funds.
The municipality has, however, done much to make the
building of bright and beautiful homes for the people
possible. It has effectually provided against any over-crowding
within its area, thus solving a problem found
insoluble in existing cities, and it offers sites of ample
size at an average rate of £6 per annum for ground-rent
and rates. Having done so much, the municipality will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
pay heed to the warning of an experienced municipal
reformer, whose desire for the extension of municipal
enterprise cannot be doubted (Mr. John Burns, M.P.,
L.C.C.), who has said: “A lot of work has been thrown
upon the Works Committee of the London County
Council by councillors who are so anxious for its success
that they would choke it by a burden of work.”</p>

<p>There are, however, other sources to which the workers
may look for means to build their own homes. They may
form building societies or induce co-operative societies,
friendly societies, and trade unions to lend them the
necessary money, and to help them to organise the requisite
machinery. Granted the existence of the true
social spirit, and not its mere letter and name, and that
spirit will manifest itself in an infinite variety of ways.
There are in this country&mdash;who can doubt it?&mdash;many
individuals and societies who would be ready to raise
funds and organise associations for assisting bodies of
workmen secure of good wages to build their own homes
on favourable terms.</p>

<p>A better security the lenders could scarcely have,
especially having regard to the ridiculously small landlord’s
rent paid by the borrowers. Certain it is that if
the building of the homes for these workmen is left to
speculative builders of a strongly-pronounced individualistic
type, and these reap golden harvests, it will be
the fault, amongst others, of those large organisations of
working-men which now place their capital in banks,
whence it is withdrawn by those who with it “exploit”
the very men who have placed it there. It is idle for
working-men to complain of this self-imposed exploitation,
and to talk of nationalising the entire land and capital of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
this country under an executive of their own class, until
they have first been through an apprenticeship at the
humbler task of organising men and women with their
own capital in constructive work of a less ambitious
character&mdash;until they have assisted far more largely than
they have yet done in building up capital, not to be
wasted in strikes, or employed by capitalists in fighting
strikers, but in securing homes and employment for themselves
and others on just and honourable terms. The true
remedy for capitalist oppression where it exists, is not the
strike of <i>no work</i>, but the strike of <i>true work</i>, and against
this last blow the oppressor has no weapon. If labour
leaders spent half the energy in co-operative organisation
that they now waste in co-operative disorganisation, the
end of our present unjust system would be at hand. In
Garden City such leaders will have a fair field for the
exercise of pro-municipal functions&mdash;functions which are
exercised for the municipality, though not by it&mdash;and the
formation of building societies of this type would be of
the greatest possible utility.</p>

<p>But would not the amount of capital required for the
building of the dwelling-houses of a town of 30,000 be
enormous? Some persons with whom I have discussed
the question look at the matter thus. So many houses in
Garden City at so many hundred of pounds a-piece,
capital required so much.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> This is, of course, quite a
mistaken way of regarding the problem. Let us test the
matter thus. How many houses have been built in
London within the last ten years? Shall we say, at the
very roughest of guesses 150,000, costing on an average<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
£300 a-piece&mdash;to say nothing of shops, factories, and
warehouses. Well, that is £45,000,000. Was £45,000,000
raised for this purpose? Yes, certainly, or the houses
would not have been built. But the money was not raised
all at once, and if one could recognise the actual sovereigns
that were raised for the building of these 150,000
houses, one would often find the very same coins turning
up again and again. So in Garden City. Before it is
completed, there will be 5,500 houses at, say, £300 a-piece,
making £1,650,000. But this capital will not be raised
all at once, and here, far more than in London, the very
same sovereigns would be employed in building many
houses. For observe, money is not lost or consumed
when it is spent. It merely changes hands. A workman
of Garden City borrows £200 from a pro-municipal
building society, and builds a house with it. That house
costs him £200, and the 200 sovereigns disappear so far
as he is concerned, but they become the property of the
brickmakers, builders, carpenters, plumbers, plasterers,
etc., who have built his house, whence those sovereigns
would find their way into the pockets of the tradesmen
and others with whom such workmen deal, and thence
would pass into the pro-municipal bank of the town, when
presently, those 200 identical sovereigns might be drawn
out and employed in building another house. Thus
there would be presented the apparent anomaly of two,
and then three, and then four or more houses, each
costing £200, being built with 200 sovereigns.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> But
there is no real anomaly about it. The coins, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
did not build the houses in any of the supposed cases.
The coins were but the measure of value, and like a pair
of scales and weights, may be used over and over again
without any perceptible lessening of their worth. What
built the houses was really labour, skill, enterprise,
working up the free gifts of nature; and though each of
the workers might have his reward weighed out to him in
coins, the cost of all buildings and works in Garden City
must be mainly determined by the skill and energy with
which its labours are directed. Still, so long as gold and
silver are recognised as the medium of exchange, it will
be necessary to use them, and of great importance to use
them skilfully&mdash;for the skill with which they are used, or
their unnecessary use dispensed with, as in a banker’s
clearing house, will have a most important bearing upon
the cost of the town, and upon the annual tax levied in
the shape of interest on borrowed capital. Skill must be
therefore directed to the object of so using coins that they
may quickly effect their object of measuring one value,
and be set to work to measure another&mdash;that they may be
turned over as many times as possible in the year, in
order that the amount of labour measured by each coin
may be as large as possible, and thus the amount represented
by interest on the coins borrowed, though paid at
the normal or usual rate, shall bear as small a proportion
as possible to the amount paid to labour. If this is done
effectively, then a saving to the community in respect of
interest as great as the more easily demonstrated saving
in landlord’s rent may probably be effected.</p>

<p>And now the reader is asked to observe how admirably,
and, as it were, automatically, a well-organised
migratory movement to land held in common lends itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
to the economic use of money, and to the making of one
coin serve many purposes. Money, it is often said, is “a
drug in the market.” Like labour itself, it seems enchanted,
and thus one sees millions in gold and silver
lying idle in banks facing the very streets where men are
wandering workless and penniless. But here, on the site
of Garden City, the cry for employment on the part of
those willing to work will no more be heard in vain. Only
yesterday it may have been so, but to-day the enchanted
land is awake, and is loudly calling for its children.
There is no difficulty in finding work&mdash;profitable work&mdash;work
that is really urgently, imperatively needed&mdash;the
building of a home-city, and, as men hasten to build up
this and the other towns which must inevitably follow its
construction, the migration to the towns&mdash;the old,
crowded, chaotic slum-towns of the past&mdash;will be
effectually checked, and the current of population set
in precisely the opposite direction&mdash;to the new towns,
bright and fair, wholesome and beautiful.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<span class="smaller">SOME DIFFICULTIES CONSIDERED.</span></h2>


<p>Having now, in a concrete rather than an abstract form,
stated the objects and purposes of our scheme, it may be
well to deal, though somewhat briefly, with an objection
which may arise in the thought of the reader: “Your
scheme may be very attractive, but it is but one of a great
number, many of which have been tried and have met
with but little success. How do you distinguish it from
those? How, in the face of such a record of failure, do
you expect to secure that large measure of public support
which is necessary ere such a scheme can be put into
operation?”</p>

<p>The question is a very natural one, and demands an
answer. My reply is: It is quite true that the pathway
of experiment towards a better state of society is strewn
with failures. But so is the pathway of experiment to
any result that is worth achieving. Success is, for the
most part, built on failure. As Mrs. Humphrey Ward
remarks in “Robert Elsmere”: “All great changes are
preceded by numbers of sporadic, and, as the bystander
thinks, intermittent efforts.” A successful invention or
discovery is usually a slow growth, to which new elements
are added, and from which old elements are removed,
first in the thought of the inventor, and subsequently in
an outward form, until at last precisely the right elements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and no others are brought together. Indeed, it may be
truly said that if you find a series of experiments continued
through many years by various workers, there will
eventually be produced the result for which so many have
been industriously searching. Long-continued effort, in
spite of failure and defeat, is the fore-runner of complete
success. He who wishes to achieve success may turn past
defeat into future victory by observing one condition.
He must profit by past experiences, and aim at retaining
all the strong points without the weaknesses of former
efforts.</p>

<p>To deal at all exhaustively here with the history of
social experiments would be beyond the scope of this
book; but a few leading features may be noticed with a
view of meeting the objection with which this chapter
opens.</p>

<p>Probably the chief cause of failure in former social experiments
has been a misconception of the principal
element in the problem&mdash;human nature itself. The
degree of strain which average human nature will bear in
an altruistic direction has not been duly considered by
those who have essayed the task of suggesting new forms
of social organisation. A kindred mistake has arisen
from regarding one principle of action to the exclusion
of others. Take Communism, for instance. Communism
is a most excellent principle, and all of us are Communists
in some degree, even those who would shudder at
being told so. For we all believe in communistic
roads, communistic parks, and communistic libraries.
But though Communism is an excellent principle,
Individualism is no less excellent. A great orchestra
which enraptures us with its delightful music is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
composed of men and women who are accustomed not
only to play together, but to practise separately, and to
delight themselves and their friends by their own, it may
be comparatively feeble, efforts. Nay, more: isolated
and individual thought and action are as essential, if the
best results of combination are to be secured, as combination
and co-operation are essential, if the best results of
isolated effort are to be gained. It is by isolated thought
that new combinations are worked out; it is through the
lessons learned in associated effort that the best individual
work is accomplished; and that society will prove the
most healthy and vigorous where the freest and fullest
opportunities are afforded alike for individual and for
combined effort.</p>

<p>Now, do not the whole series of communistic experiments
owe their failure largely to this&mdash;that they have
not recognised this duality of principle, but have carried
one principle, excellent enough in itself, altogether too
far? They have assumed that because common property
is good, all property should be common; that because
associated effort can produce marvels, individual effort is
to be regarded as dangerous, or at least futile, some extremists
even seeking to abolish altogether the idea of
the family or home. No reader will confuse the experiment
here advocated with any experiment in absolute
Communism.</p>

<p>Nor is the scheme to be regarded as a socialistic experiment.
Socialists, who may be regarded as Communists
of a more moderate type, advocate common property in
land and in all the instruments of production, distribution,
and exchange&mdash;railways, machinery, factories,
docks, banks, and the like; but they would preserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the principle of private ownership in all such things
as have passed in the form of wages to the servants
of the community, with the proviso, however, that
these wages shall not be employed in organised creative
effort, involving the employment of more than one
person; for all forms of employment with a view to
remuneration should, as the Socialists contend, be under
the direction of some recognised department of the
Government, which is to claim a rigid monopoly. But it
is very doubtful whether this principle of the Socialist,
in which there is a certain measure of recognition of the
individual side of man’s nature as well as of his social
side, represents a basis on which an experiment can fairly
proceed with the hope of permanent success. Two chief
difficulties appear to present themselves. First, the self-seeking
side of man&mdash;his too frequent desire to produce,
with a view to possessing for his own personal use and
enjoyment; and, secondly, his love of independence and
of initiative, his personal ambition, and his consequent
unwillingness to put himself under the guidance of others
for the whole of his working day, with little opportunity
of striking out some independent line of action, or of
taking a leading part in the creation of new forms of
enterprise.</p>

<p>Now, even if we pass over the first difficulty&mdash;that of
human self-seeking&mdash;even if we assume that we have a
body of men and women who have realised the truth that
concerted social effort will achieve far better results in
enjoyable commodities for each member of the community
than can possibly be achieved by ordinary competitive
methods&mdash;each struggling for himself&mdash;we have still the
other difficulty, arising out of the higher and not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
lower nature of the men and women who are to be
organised&mdash;their love of independence and of initiative.
Men love combined effort, but they love individual effort,
too, and they will not be content with such few opportunities
for personal effort as they would be allowed to
make in a rigid socialistic community. Men do not
object to being organised under competent leadership,
but some also want to be leaders, and to have a share in
the work of organising; they like to lead as well as to
be led. Besides, one can easily imagine men filled with a
desire to serve the community in some way which the
community as a whole did not at the moment appreciate
the advantage of, and who would be precluded by the
very constitution of the socialistic state from carrying
their proposals into effect.</p>

<p>Now, it is at this very point that a most interesting
experiment at Topolobampo has broken down. The
experiment, which was initiated by Mr. A. K. Owen, an
American civil engineer, was started on a considerable
tract of land obtained under concession from the Mexican
Government. One principle adopted by Mr. Owen was
that “all employment must be through the Department
for the Diversity of Home Industries. One member
cannot directly employ another member, and only
members can be employed through the settlement.”<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> In
other words, if A. and B. were dissatisfied with the
management, whether owing to doubts as to its competency
or honesty, they could not arrange to work with
each other, even though their sole desire might be the
common good; but they must leave the settlement. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
this is what they accordingly did in very considerable
numbers.</p>

<p>It is at this point that a great distinction between the
Topolobampo experiment and the scheme advocated in
this work is evident. In Topolobampo the organisation
claimed a monopoly of all productive work, and each
member must work under the direction of those who controlled
that monopoly, or must leave the organisation.
In Garden City no such monopoly is claimed, and any
dissatisfaction with the public administration of the
affairs of the town would no more necessarily lead to a
widespread split in Garden City than in any other municipality.
At the outset, at least, by far the larger part
of the work done will be by individuals or combinations
of individuals quite other than municipal servants, just
as in any other municipality, at present existing, the
sphere of municipal work is still very small as compared
with the work performed by other groups.</p>

<p>Other sources of failure in some social experiments
are the considerable expense incurred by migrants before
they reach the scene of their future labours, the great
distance from any large market, and the difficulty of previously
obtaining any real knowledge of the conditions of
life and labour there prevailing. The one advantage
gained&mdash;cheap land&mdash;seems to be altogether insufficient
to compensate for these and other disadvantages.</p>

<p>We now come to what is perhaps the chief difference
between the scheme advocated in this work and most
other schemes of a like nature which have been hitherto
advocated or put into actual practice. That difference is
this: While others have sought to weld into one large
organisation individuals who have not yet been combined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
into smaller groups, or who must leave those smaller
groups on their joining the larger organisation, my proposal
appeals not only to individuals but to co-operators,
manufacturers, philanthropic societies, and others experienced
in organisation, and with organisations under
their control, to come and place themselves under conditions
involving no new restraints but rather securing
wider freedom. And, further, a striking feature of the
present scheme is that the very considerable number of
persons already engaged on the estate will not be displaced
(except those on the town site, and these gradually),
but these will themselves form a valuable nucleus, paying
in rents, from the very inception of the enterprise, a sum
which will go very far towards the interest on the money
with which the estate is purchased&mdash;rents which they
will be more willing to pay to a landlord who will treat
them with perfect equity, and who will bring to
their doors consumers for their produce. The work
of organisation is, therefore, in a very large measure
accomplished. The army is now in existence; it has but
to be mobilised; it is with no undisciplined mob that we
have to deal. Or the comparison between this experiment
and those which have preceded it is like that
between two machines&mdash;one of which has to be created
out of various ores which have first to be gathered
together and then cast into various shapes, while for the
other all the parts are ready to hand and have but to be
fitted together.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

<span class="smaller">A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF PROPOSALS.</span></h2>


<p>In the last chapter, I pointed out the great differences of
principle between the project placed before the reader of
this work and some of those schemes of social reform
which, having been put to the test of experience, have
ended in disaster, and I urged that there were features of
the proposed experiment which so completely distinguished
it from those unsuccessful schemes that they
could not be fairly regarded as any indication of the
results which would probably follow from launching this
experiment.</p>

<p>It is my present purpose to show that though the
scheme taken as a whole is a new one, and is, perhaps,
entitled to some consideration on that account, its chief
claim upon the attention of the public lies in the fact that
it combines the important features of several schemes
which have been advocated at various times, and so
combines them as to secure the best results of each,
without the dangers and difficulties which sometimes,
even in the minds of their authors, were clearly and distinctly
seen.</p>

<p>Shortly stated, my scheme is a combination of three
distinct projects which have, I think, never been united
before. These are&mdash;(1) The proposals for an organised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
migratory movement of population of Wakefield and of
Professor Marshall; (2) the system of land tenure first
proposed by Thos. Spence and afterwards (though with an
important modification) by Mr. Herbert Spencer; and (3)
the model city of Jas. S. Buckingham.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Let us take these proposals in the order named.
Wakefield, in his “Art of Colonisation” (London: J. W.
Parker, 1849), urged that colonies when formed&mdash;he was
not thinking of home colonies&mdash;should be based on
scientific principles. He said (page 109): “We send out
colonies of the limbs, without the belly and the head, of
needy persons, many of them mere paupers, or even
criminals; colonies made up of <i>a single class of persons</i>
in the community, and that the most helpless and the
most unfit to perpetuate our national character, and to
become the fathers of a race whose habits of thinking and
feeling shall correspond to those which, in the meantime,
we are cherishing at home. The ancients, on the contrary,
sent out <i>a representation of the parent State&mdash;colonists
from all ranks</i>. We stock the farm with
creeping and climbing plants, without any trees of firmer
growth for them to entwine round. A hop-ground
without poles, the plants matted confusedly together, and
scrambling on the ground in tangled heaps, with here and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
there some clinging to rank thistles and hemlock, would
be an apt emblem of a modern colony. The ancients
began by nominating to the honourable office of captain
or leader of the colony one of the chief men, if not the
chief man of the State, like the queen bee leading the
workers. Monarchies provided a prince of the royal
blood; an aristocracy its choicest nobleman; a democracy
its most influential citizen. These naturally carried along
with them some of their own station in life&mdash;their companions
and friends; some of their immediate dependents
also&mdash;of those between themselves and the lowest class;
and were encouraged in various ways to do so. The
lowest class again followed with alacrity, because they
found themselves moving <i>with</i> and not <i>away from</i> the
state of society in which they had been living. It was
the same social and political union under which they had
been born and bred; and to prevent any contrary impression
being made, the utmost solemnity was observed in
transferring the rites of pagan superstition. They carried
with them their gods, their festivals, their games&mdash;all, in
short, that held together and kept entire the fabric of
society as it existed in the parent state. Nothing was
left behind that could be moved of all that the heart or
eye of an exile misses. The new colony was made to
appear as if time or chance had reduced the whole community
to smaller dimensions, leaving it still essentially
the same home and country to its surviving members. It
consisted of a general contribution of members from all
classes, and so became, on its first settlement, a mature
state, with all the component parts of that which sent it
forth. It was a transfer of population, therefore, which
gave rise to no sense of degradation, as if the colonist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
were thrust out from a higher to a lower description of
community.”</p>

<p>J. S. Mill, in his “Elements of Political Economy,”
Book I., Chap. viii., § 3, says of this work: “Wakefield’s
theory of colonisation has excited much attention, and is
doubtless destined to excite much more.... His
system consists of arrangements for securing that each
colony shall have from the first a town population bearing
due proportion to the agricultural, and that the cultivators
of the soil shall not be so widely scattered as to
be deprived by distance of the benefit of that town
population as a market for their produce.”</p>

<p>Professor Marshall’s proposals for an organised
migratory movement of population from London have
been already noticed, but the following passage from the
article already referred to may be quoted:&mdash;</p>

<p>“There might be great variety of method, but the
general plan would probably be for a committee, whether
formed specially for the purpose or not, to interest themselves
in the formation of a colony in some place well
beyond the range of London smoke. After seeing their
way to building or buying suitable cottages there, they
would enter into communication with some of the employers
of low-waged labour. They would select, at first, industries
that used very little fixed capital; and, as we have
seen, it fortunately happens that most of the industries
which it is important to move are of this kind. They
would find an employer&mdash;and there must be many such&mdash;who
really cares for the misery of his employees. Acting
with him and by his advice, they would make themselves
the friends of people employed or fit to be employed in
his trade; they would show them the advantages of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
moving, and help them to move, both with counsel and
money. They would organise the sending of work backwards
and forwards, the employer perhaps opening an
agency in the colony. But after being once started it
ought to be self-supporting, for the cost of carriage, even
if the employees went in sometimes to get instructions,
would be less than the saving made in rent&mdash;at all events,
if allowance be made for the value of the garden produce.
And more than as much gain would probably be saved
by removing the temptation to drink which is caused by
the sadness of London. They would meet with much
passive resistance at first. The unknown has terrors to
all, but especially to those who have lost their natural
spring. Those who have lived always in the obscurity of
a London court might shrink away from the free light;
poor as are their acquaintanceships at home, they might
fear to go where they knew no one. But, with gentle insistence,
the committee would urge their way, trying to
get those who knew one another to move together, by
warm, patient sympathy, taking off the chill of the first
change. It is only the first step that costs; every succeeding
step would be easier. The work of several firms,
not always in the same business, might, in some cases, be
sent together. Gradually a prosperous industrial district
would grow up, and then, mere self-interest would induce
employers to bring down their main workshops, and even
to start factories in the colony. Ultimately all would
gain, but most the landowners and the railroads connected
with the colony.”</p>

<p>What could more strongly point than the last sentence
of that quotation from Professor Marshall’s proposal to the
necessity of first <i>buying</i> the land, so that the most admir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>able
project of Thomas Spence can be put into practice,
and thus prevent the terrible rise in rent which Professor
Marshall forsees? Spence’s proposal, put forward more
than a hundred years ago, at once suggests how to secure
the desired end. Here it is:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Then you may behold the rent which the people have
paid into the parish treasuries employed by each parish
in paying the Government its share of the sum which the
Parliament or National Congress at any time grants; in
maintaining and relieving its own poor and people out of
work; in paying the necessary officers their salaries; in
building, repairing, and adorning its houses, bridges, and
other structures; in making and maintaining convenient
and delightful streets, highways, and passages, both for
foot and carriages; in making and maintaining canals
and other conveniences for trade and navigation; in
planting and taking in waste grounds; in premiums for
the encouragement of agriculture or anything else
thought worthy of encouragement; and, in a word, in
doing whatever the people think proper, and not, as
formerly, to support and spread luxury, pride, and all
manner of vice.... There are no tolls or taxes of
any kind paid among them by native or foreigner but the
aforesaid rent, which every person pays to the parish,
according to the quantity, quality, and conveniences of
the land ... he occupies in it. The government,
poor, roads, etc., ... are all maintained with the rent,
on which account all wares, manufactures, allowable trade
employments or actions are entirely duty-free.”&mdash;From a
lecture read at the Philosophical Society in Newcastle, on
November 8th, 1775, for printing which the Society did
the author the honour to expel him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be observed that the only difference between
this proposal and the proposals as to land reform put
forward in this book, is not a difference of system, but a
difference (and a very important one) as to the <i>method</i> of
its inauguration. Spence appears to have thought that
the people would, by a fiat, dispossess the existing owners
and establish the system at once and universally throughout
the country; while, in this work, it is proposed to
purchase the necessary land with which to establish the
system on a small scale, and to trust to the inherent
advantages of the system leading to its gradual adoption.</p>

<p>Writing some seventy years after Spence had put
forward his proposal, Mr. Herbert Spencer (having first
laid down the grand principle that all men are equally
entitled to the use of the earth, as a corollary of the law
of equal liberty generally), in discussing this subject,
observes, with his usual force and clearness:&mdash;</p>

<p>“But to what does this doctrine that men are equally
entitled to the use of the earth, lead? Must we return to
the times of unenclosed wilds, and subsist on roots,
berries, and game? Or are we to be left to the management
of Messrs. Fourrier, Owen, Louis Blanc &amp; Co.?
Neither. Such a doctrine is consistent with the highest
civilisation, may be carried out without involving a community
of goods, and need cause no very serious revolution
in existing arrangements. The change required
would be simply a change of landlords. Separate ownership
would merge in the joint-stock ownership of the
public. Instead of being in the possession of individuals,
the country would be held by the great corporate
body&mdash;society. Instead of leasing his acres from an
isolated proprietor, the farmer would lease them from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
nation. Instead of paying his rent to the agent of Sir
John and His Grace, he would pay it to an agent or
deputy agent of the community. Stewards would be
public officials instead of private ones, and tenancy the
only land tenure. A state of things so ordered would be
in perfect harmony with the moral law. Under it all
men would be equally landlords; all men would be alike
free to become tenants. A., B., C. and the rest might
compete for a vacant farm as now, and one of them might
take that farm without in any way violating the principles
of pure equity. All would be equally free to bid;
all would be equally free to refrain. And when the farm
had been let to A., B., or C., all parties would have done
that which they willed, the one in choosing to pay a
given sum to his fellow-men for the use of certain lands&mdash;the
others in refusing to pay the sum. Clearly, therefore,
on such a system the earth might be enclosed,
occupied, and cultivated in entire subordination to the
law of equal freedom.”&mdash;“Social Statics,” Chap. ix.,
sec. 8.</p>

<p>But having thus written, Mr. Herbert Spencer at a
later period, having discovered two grave difficulties in
the way of his own proposal, unreservedly withdrew it.
The first of these difficulties was the evils which he
considered as inseparable from State ownership (see
“Justice,” published in 1891, appendix B., p. 290); the
second, the impossibility, as Mr. Spencer regarded it, of
acquiring the land on terms which would be at once
equitable to existing owners and remunerative to the
community.</p>

<p>But if the reader examines the scheme of Spence,
which preceded the now-withdrawn proposals of Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Herbert Spencer, he will see that Spence’s scheme was
entirely freed (as is the one put forward in this little
book), from the objections which might probably attend
control by the State.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The rents were, under Spence’s
proposals, as in my own, not to be levied by a
<i>Central Government</i> far removed from contact with
the people, but by the very parish (in my scheme
the municipality) in which the people reside. As
to the other difficulty which presented itself to
Mr. Herbert Spencer’s mind&mdash;that of acquiring
the land on equitable terms, and of yet making it remunerative
to the purchasers&mdash;a difficulty which Mr.
Herbert Spencer, seeing no way out of, rashly concluded
to be insuperable&mdash;that difficulty is entirely removed by
my proposal of buying agricultural or sparsely-settled
land, letting it in the manner advocated by Spence, and
then bringing about the scientific migratory movement
advocated by Wakefield and (though in a somewhat less
daring fashion) by Professor Marshall.</p>

<p>Surely a project, which thus brings what Mr. Herbert
Spencer still terms “the dictum of absolute ethics”&mdash;that
all men are equally entitled to the use of the earth&mdash;into
the field of practical life, and makes it a thing immediately
realisable by those who believe in it, must be one of
the greatest public importance. When a great philosopher
in effect says, we cannot conform our life to the highest
moral principles because men have laid an immoral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
foundation for us in the past, but “if, while possessing
those ethical sentiments which social discipline has now
produced, men stood in possession of a territory not
yet individually portioned out, they would no
more hesitate to assert equality of their claims
to the land than they would hesitate to assert
equality of their claims to light and air”<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>&mdash;one
cannot help wishing&mdash;so inharmonious does life seem&mdash;that
the opportunity presented itself of migrating to a
new planet where the “ethical sentiments which social
discipline has now produced” might be indulged in.
But a new planet, or even “a territory not yet individually
portioned out,” is by no means necessary if we are
but in real earnest; for it has been shown that an
organised, migratory movement from over-developed,
high-priced land to comparatively raw and unoccupied
land, will enable all who desire it to live this life of equal
freedom and opportunity; and a sense of the possibility
of a life on earth at once orderly and free dawns upon
the heart and mind.</p>

<p>The third proposal which I have combined with those
of Spence and Mr. Herbert Spencer, of Wakefield and
Professor Marshall, embraces one essential feature of a
scheme of James S. Buckingham,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> though I have purposely
omitted some of the essential features of that
scheme. Mr. Buckingham says (p. 25): “My thoughts
were thus directed to the great defects of all existing
towns, and the desirability of forming at least one model<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
town which should avoid the most prominent of these
defects, and substitute advantages not yet possessed by
any.” In his work he exhibits a ground plan and a
sketch of a town of about 1,000 acres, containing a
population of 25,000, and surrounded by a large agricultural
estate. Buckingham, like Wakefield, saw the great
advantages to be derived by combining an agricultural
community with an industrial, and urged: “Wherever
practicable, the labours of agriculture and manufacture
to be so mingled and the variety of fabrics and materials
to be wrought upon also so assorted as to make short
periods of labour on each alternately with others produce
that satisfaction and freedom from tedium and weariness
which an unbroken round of monotonous occupation so
frequently occasions, and because also variety of employment
develops the mental as well as physical faculties
much more perfectly than any single occupation.”</p>

<p>But though on these points the scheme is strikingly
like my own, it is also a very different one. Buckingham
having traced, as he thought, the evils of society to their
source in competition, intemperance, and war, proposed
to annihilate competition by forming a system of complete
or integral co-operation; to remove intemperance
by the total exclusion of intoxicants; to put an end to
war by the absolute prohibition of gunpowder. He proposed
to form a large company, with a capital of
£4,000,000; to buy a large estate, and to erect churches,
schools, factories, warehouses, dining-halls, dwelling-houses,
at rents varying from £30 a year to £300 a year;
and to carry on all productive operations, whether agricultural
or industrial, as one large undertaking covering
the whole field and permitting no rivals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Now it will be seen that though in outward form
Buckingham’s scheme and my own present the same
feature of a model town set in a large agricultural estate,
so that industrial and farming pursuits might be carried
on in a healthy, natural way, yet the inner life of the two
communities would be entirely different&mdash;the inhabitants
of Garden City enjoying the fullest rights of free association,
and exhibiting the most varied forms of individual
and co-operative work and endeavour, the members of
Buckingham’s city being held together by the bonds of a
rigid cast-iron organisation, from which there could be no
escape but by leaving the association, or breaking it up
into various sections.</p>

<p>To sum up this chapter. My proposal is that there
should be an earnest attempt made to organise a
migratory movement of population from our overcrowded
centres to sparsely-settled rural districts; that the mind
of the public should not be confused, or the efforts of
organisers wasted in a premature attempt to accomplish
this work on a national scale, but that great thought and
attention shall be first concentrated on a single movement
yet one sufficiently large to be at once attractive and
resourceful; that the migrants shall be guaranteed (by
the making of suitable arrangements before the movement
commences) that the whole increase in land-values
due to their migration shall be secured to them; that this
be done by creating an organisation, which, while permitting
its members to do those things which are good
in their own eyes (provided they infringe not the rights
of others) shall receive all “rate-rents” and expend
them in those public works which the migratory movement
renders necessary or expedient&mdash;thus eliminating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
rates, or, at least, greatly reducing the necessity for any
compulsory levy; and that the golden opportunity
afforded by the fact that the land to be settled upon has
but few buildings or works upon it, shall be availed of in
the fullest manner, by so laying out a Garden City that, as
it grows, the free gifts of Nature&mdash;fresh air, sunlight,
breathing room and playing room&mdash;shall be still retained
in all needed abundance, and by so employing the
resources of modern science that Art may supplement
Nature, and life may become an abiding joy and delight.
And it is important to notice that this proposal, so imperfectly
put forward, is no scheme hatched in a restless
night in the fevered brain of an enthusiast, but is one
having its origin in the thoughtful study of many minds,
and the patient effort of many earnest souls, each
bringing some element of value, till, the time and the
opportunity having come, the smallest skill avails to weld
those elements into an effective combination.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<span class="smaller">THE PATH FOLLOWED UP.</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“How can a man learn to know himself? By reflection
never&mdash;only by action. In the measure that thou seekest to do
thy duty shalt thou know what is in thee. But what is thy
duty? The demand of the hour.”&mdash;<i>Goethe.</i></p></div>


<p>The reader is now asked to kindly assume, for the sake of
argument, that our Garden City experiment has been
fairly launched, and is a decided success, and to consider
briefly some of the more important effects which such an
object-lesson, by the light which it will throw upon the
pathway of reform, must inevitably produce upon society,
and then we will endeavour to trace some of the broader
features of the after-development.</p>

<p>Among the greatest needs of man and of society
to-day, as at all times, are these: A worthy aim and
opportunity to realise it; work and ends worth working
for. All that a man is, and all that he may become, is
summed up in his aspirations, and this is no less true of
society than of the individual. The end I venture to
now set before the people of this country and of other
countries is no less “noble and adequate” than this, that
they should forthwith gird themselves to the task of
building up clusters of beautiful home-towns, each zoned
by gardens, for those who now dwell in crowded, slum-infested
cities. We have already seen how <i>one</i> such town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
may be built; let us now see how the true path of reform,
once discovered, will, if resolutely followed, lead society
on to a far higher destiny than it has ever yet ventured
to hope for, though such a future has often been foretold
by daring spirits.</p>

<p>There have in the past been inventions and discoveries
on the making of which society has suddenly leaped
upward to a new and higher plane of existence. The
utilisation of steam&mdash;a force long recognised, but which
proved somewhat difficult to harness to the task it was
fitted to accomplish&mdash;effected mighty changes; but the
discovery of a method for giving effect to a far greater
force than the force of steam&mdash;to the long pent-up desire
for a better and nobler social life here on earth&mdash;will
work changes even more remarkable.</p>

<p>What clearly marked economic truth is brought into
view by the successful issue of such an experiment as we
have been advocating? This:&mdash;That there is a broad path
open, through a creation of new wealth forms, to a new
industrial system in which the productive forces of society
and of nature may be used with far greater effectiveness
than at present, and in which the distribution of the
wealth forms so created will take place on a far juster and
more equitable basis. Society may have more to divide
among its members, and at the same time the greater
dividend may be divided in a juster manner.</p>

<p>Speaking broadly, industrial reformers may be
divided into two camps. The first camp includes those
who urge the primary importance of paying close and
constant attention to the necessity of <i>increased production</i>:
the second includes those whose special aim
is directed to <i>more just and equitable division</i>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
former are constantly saying, in effect, “Increase the
national dividend, and all will be well”; the latter, “The
national dividend is fairly sufficient were it but divided
equitably.” The former are for the most part of the individualistic,
the latter of the socialistic type.</p>

<p>As an instance of the former point of view, I may cite
the words of Mr. A. J. Balfour, who, at a Conference of
the National Union of Conservative Associations held at
Sunderland on 14th November, 1894, said: “Those who
represented society as if it consisted of two sections disputing
over their share of the general produce were
utterly mistaken as to the real bearing of the great social
problem. We had to consider that the produce of the
country was not a fixed quantity, of which, if the employers
got more, the employed would get less, or if the
employed got more, the employers would get less. The
real question for the working-classes of this country was
not primarily or fundamentally a question of division: it
was a question of production.” As an instance of the
second point of view, take the following: “The absurdity
of the notion of raising the poor without, to a corresponding
degree, depressing the rich will be obvious.”&mdash;“Principles
of Socialism made plain,” by Frank Fairman
(William Reeves, 83 Charing Cross Road, W.C.), page 33.</p>

<p>I have already shown, and I hope to make this contention
yet more clear, that there is a path along which
sooner or later, both the Individualist and the Socialist
must inevitably travel; for I have made it abundantly
clear that on a small scale society may readily become
more individualistic than now&mdash;if by Individualism is
meant a society in which there is fuller and freer opportunity
for its members to do and to produce what they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
will, and to form free associations, of the most varied
kinds; while it may also become more socialistic&mdash;if by
Socialism is meant a condition of life in which the well-being
of the community is safe-guarded, and in which
the collective spirit is manifested by a wide extension of
the area of municipal effort. To achieve these desirable
ends, I have taken a leaf out of the books of each type of
reformer and bound them together by a thread of
practicability. Not content with <i>urging</i> the necessity of
increased production, I have shown <i>how it can be
achieved</i>; while the other and equally important end of
more equitable distribution is, as I have shown, easily
possible, and in a manner which need cause no ill-will,
strife, or bitterness; is constitutional; requires no revolutionary
legislation; and involves no direct attack upon
vested interests. Thus may the desires of the two sections
of reformers to whom I have referred be attained. I
have, in short, followed out Lord Rosebery’s suggestion,
and “borrowed from Socialism its large conception of
common effort, and its vigorous conception of municipal
life, and from Individualism the preservation of self-respect
and self-reliance,” and, by a concrete illustration,
I have, I think, disproved the cardinal contention of Mr.
Benjamin Kidd in his famous book, “Social Evolution,”
that “the interests of the social organism and of the individuals
comprising it at any particular time are actually
antagonistic; they can never be reconciled; they are inherently
and essentially irreconcilable” (page 85).</p>

<p>Most socialistic writers appear to me to exhibit too
keen a desire to appropriate old forms of wealth, either
by purchasing out or by taxing out the owners, and they
seem to have little conception that the truer method is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
create new forms and to create them under juster conditions.
But this latter conception should inevitably
follow an adequate realisation of the ephemeral nature
of most forms of wealth; and there is no truth more fully
recognised by economic writers than that nearly all forms
of material wealth, except, indeed, the planet on which
we live and the elements of nature, are extremely fugitive
and prone to decay. Thus for instance, J. S. Mill, in
“Elements of Political Economy,” Book 1, Chapter v.,
says: “The greater part in value of the wealth now
existing in England has been produced by human hands
within the last twelve months. A very small proportion
indeed of that large aggregate was in existence ten years
ago;&mdash;of the present productive capital of the country,
scarcely any part except farm-houses and manufactories
and a few ships and machines; and even these would not
in most cases have survived so long if fresh labour had
not been employed within that period in putting them
into repair. The land subsists, and the land is almost
the only thing that subsists.” The leaders of the great
socialistic movement, of course, know all this perfectly
well; yet this quite elementary truth seems to fade from
their minds when they are discussing methods of reform,
and they appear to be as anxious to seize upon present
forms of wealth as if they regarded them as of a really
lasting and permanent nature.</p>

<p>But this inconsistency of socialistic writers is all the
more striking when one remembers that these writers are
the very ones who insist most strongly upon the view that
a very large part of the wealth-forms now in existence
are not really <i>wealth</i> at all&mdash;that they are “filth,” and
that any form of society which represents even a step<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
towards their ideal must involve the sweeping away of
such forms and the creation of new forms in their place.
With a degree of inconsistency that is positively startling,
they exhibit an insatiable desire to become possessed of
these forms of wealth which are not only rapidly
decaying, but are in their opinion absolutely useless or
injurious.</p>

<p>Thus Mr Hyndman, at a lecture delivered at the
Democratic Club, 29th March, 1893, said:&mdash;“It was
desirable that they should map out and formulate
socialistic ideas which they should desire to see brought
about when the so-called Individualism of the present
day has broken down, as it inevitably would do. One of
the first things that they as Socialists would have to do
would be to depopulate the vast centres of their over-crowded
cities. Their large towns had no longer any
large agricultural population from which to recruit their
ranks, and through bad and insufficient food, vitiated
atmosphere, and other insanitary conditions, the
physique of the masses of the cities was rapidly deteriorating,
both materially and physically.” Precisely;
but does not Mr. Hyndman see that in striving to become
possessed of present wealth forms, he is laying siege to
the wrong fortress? If the population of London, or a
large part of the population of London, is to be transplanted
elsewhere, when some future event has happened,
would it not be well to see if we cannot induce large
numbers of these people to transplant themselves <i>now</i>,
when the problem of London administration and of
London reform would, as we shall shortly discover, present
itself in a somewhat startling fashion?</p>

<p>A similar inconsistency is to be noticed in a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
book which has had an enormous and well-deserved sale,
“Merrie England” (Clarion Offices, Fleet Street). The
author, “Nunquam,” remarks at the outset: “The
problem we have to consider is:&mdash;Given a country and a
people, find how the people may make the best of the
country and themselves.” He then proceeds to
vigorously condemn our cities, with their houses ugly and
mean, their narrow streets, their want of gardens, and
emphasises the advantages of out-door occupations. He
condemns the factory system, and says: “I would set
men to grow wheat and fruit, and rear cattle and poultry
for our own use. Then I would develop the fisheries, and
construct great fish-breeding lakes and harbours. Then
I would restrict our mines, furnaces, chemical works, and
factories to the number actually needed for the supply
of our own people. Then I would stop the smoke
nuisance by developing water-power and electricity. <i>In
order to achieve these ends, I would make all the lands,
mills, mines, factories, works, shops, ships, and railways
the property of the people.</i>” That is (the italics are my
own), the people are to struggle hard to become possessed
of factories, mills, works, and shops, at least half of which
must be closed if Nunquam’s desires are attained; of
ships which will become useless if our foreign trade is
to be abandoned, (<i>see</i> “Merrie England,” Chap. iv.); and
of railways, which, with an entire redistribution of population
such as Nunquam desires, must for the most part
become derelict. And how long is this useless struggle
to last? Would it not&mdash;I ask Nunquam to consider this
point carefully&mdash;be better to study a smaller problem
first, and, to paraphrase his words, “Given, say, 6,000
acres of land, let us endeavour to make the best use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
it”? For then, having dealt with this, we shall have
educated ourselves to deal with a larger area.</p>

<p>Let me state again in other terms this fugitiveness of
wealth forms, and then suggest the conclusion to which
that consideration should lead us. So marked are the
changes which society exhibits&mdash;especially a society in a
progressive state&mdash;that the outward and visible forms
which our civilisation presents to-day, its public and
private buildings, its means of communication, the
appliances with which it works, its machinery, its docks,
its artificial harbours, its instruments of war and its
instruments of peace, have most of them undergone a
complete change, and many of them several complete
changes, within the last sixty years. I suppose not one
person in twenty in this country is living in a house
which is sixty years old; not one sailor in a thousand is
sailing a ship, not one artisan or labourer in a hundred
is engaged in a workshop or handling tools or driving a
cart which was in existence sixty years ago. It is now
sixty years since the first railway was constructed from
Birmingham to London, and our Railway Companies
possess one thousand millions of invested capital, while
our systems of water supply, of gas, of electric lighting,
and of sewerage are, for the most part, of recent date.
Those material relics of the past which were created more
than sixty years ago, though some of them are of infinite
value as mementos, examples, and heirlooms, are, for the
most part, certainly not of a kind which we need wrangle
over or fight about. The best of them are our universities,
schools, churches, and cathedrals, and these should
certainly teach us a different lesson.</p>

<p>But can any reasonable person, who reflects for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
moment on the recent unexampled rate of progress and
invention, doubt that the next sixty years will reveal
changes fully as remarkable? Can any person suppose
that these mushroom forms, which have sprung up as it
were in a night, have any real permanence? Even apart
from the solution of the labour problem, and the finding
of work for the thousands of idle hands which are eager
for it&mdash;a solution, the correctness of which I claim to
have demonstrated&mdash;what possibilities are opened up by
the bare contemplation of the discovery of new motive
powers, new means of locomotion, perhaps, through the
air, new methods of water supply, or a new distribution
of population, which must of itself render many material
forms altogether useless and effete! Why, then, should
we squabble and wrangle about what man <i>has</i> produced?
Why not rather seek to learn what man <i>can</i> produce;
when, aiming to do that, we may perhaps discover a
grand opportunity for producing not only better forms of
wealth, but how to produce them under far juster conditions?
To quote the author of “Merrie England”:
“We should first of all ascertain what things are
desirable for our health and happiness of body and mind,
and then organise our people with the object of producing
those things in the best and easiest way.”</p>

<p>Wealth forms, then, in their very nature are
<i>fugitive</i>, and they are besides liable to constant displacement
by the better forms which in an advancing state of
society are constantly arising. There is, however, one
form of material wealth which is most permanent and
abiding; from the value and utility of which our most
wonderful inventions can never detract one jot, but will
serve only to make more clear, and to render more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
universal. The planet on which we live has lasted
for millions of years, and the race is just emerging
from its savagery. Those of us who believe that
there is a grand purpose behind nature cannot believe
that the career of this planet is likely to be speedily
cut short now that better hopes are rising in the
hearts of men, and that, having learned a few of its less
obscure secrets, they are finding their way, through much
toil and pain, to a more noble use of its infinite
treasures. The earth for all practical purposes may be
regarded as abiding for ever.</p>

<p>Now, as every form of wealth must rest on the earth
as its foundation, and must be built up out of the constituents
found at or near its surface, it follows (because
foundations are ever of primary importance) that the
reformer should first consider how best the earth may be
used in the service of man. But here again our friends,
the Socialists, miss the essential point. Their professed
ideal is to make society the owner of land <i>and of all
instruments of production</i>; but they have been so anxious
to carry both points of their programme that they have
been a little too slow to consider the special importance
of the land question, and have thus missed the true path
of reform.</p>

<p>There is, however, a type of reformers who push the
land question very much to the front, though, as it
appears to me, in a manner little likely to commend their
views to society. Mr. Henry George, in his well-known
work, “Progress and Poverty,” urges with much
eloquence, if not with complete accuracy of reasoning,
that our land laws are responsible for all the economic
evils of society, and that as our landlords are little better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
than pirates and robbers, the sooner the State forcibly
appropriates their rents the better, for when this is
accomplished the problem of poverty will, he suggests,
be entirely solved. But is not this attempt to throw the
whole blame of and punishment for the present deplorable
condition of society on to a single class of men a very
great mistake? In what way are landlords as a class less
honest than the average citizen? Give the average
citizen the opportunity of becoming a landlord and of
appropriating the land values created by his tenants, and
he will embrace it to-morrow. If then, the average man
is a potential landlord, to attack landlords as individuals
is very like a nation drawing up an indictment against
itself, and then making a scape-goat of a particular class.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>But to endeavour to change our land system is a very
different matter from attacking those individuals who
represent it. But how is this change to be effected? I
reply&mdash;By the force of example, that is, by setting up a
better system, and by a little skill in the grouping of
forces and manipulation of ideas. It is quite true that
the average man is a potential landlord, and as ready to
appropriate the unearned increment as to cry out against
its appropriation. But the average man has very little
chance of ever becoming a landlord and of appropriating
rent-values created by others; and he is, therefore, the
better able to consider, quite dispassionately, whether
such a proceeding is really honest, and whether it may
not be possible to gradually establish a new and more
equitable system under which, without enjoying the
privilege of appropriating rent-values created by others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
he may himself be secured against expropriation of the
rent-values which he is now constantly creating or maintaining.
We have demonstrated how this may be done
on a small scale; we have next to consider how the
experiment may be carried out on a much wider scale,
and this we can best do in another chapter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<span class="smaller">SOCIAL CITIES.</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Human nature will not flourish, any more than a potato, if
it be planted and re-planted for too long a series of generations
in the same worn-out soil. My children have had other birthplaces,
and, so far as their fortunes may be within my control,
shall strike their roots into unaccustomed earth.”&mdash;“The
Scarlet Letter,” Nathaniel Hawthorne.</p></div>


<p>The problem with which we have now to deal, shortly
stated, is this: How to make our Garden City experiment
the stepping-stone to a higher and better form of industrial
life generally throughout the country. Granted
the success of the initial experiment, and there must
inevitably arise a widespread demand for an extension of
methods so healthy and so advantageous; and it will be
well, therefore, to consider some of the chief problems
which will have to be faced in the progress of such
extension.</p>

<p>It will, I think, be well, in approaching this question,
to consider the analogy presented by the early progress of
railway enterprise. This will help us to see more clearly
some of the broader features of the new development
which is now so closely upon us if only we show ourselves
energetic and imaginative. Railways were first
made without any statutory powers. They were con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>structed
on a very small scale, and, being of very short
lengths, the consent of only one or at the most a few
landowners was necessary; and what private agreement
and arrangement could thus easily compass was scarcely
a fit subject for an appeal to the Legislature of the
country. But when the “Rocket” was built, and the
supremacy of the locomotive was fully established, it then
became necessary, if railway enterprise was to go forward,
to obtain legislative powers. For it would have been
impossible, or at least very difficult, to make equitable
arrangements with all the landowners whose estates
might lie between points many miles distant; because
one obstinate landlord might take advantage of his position
to demand an altogether exorbitant price for his
land, and thus practically stifle such an enterprise. It
was necessary, therefore, to obtain power to secure the
land compulsorily at its market value, or at a price not
too extravagantly removed from such value; and, this
being done, railway enterprise went forward at so rapid
a rate that in one year no less than £132,600,000 was
authorised by Parliament to be raised for the purpose of
railway construction.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Now, if Parliamentary powers were necessary for the
extension of railway enterprise, such powers will certainly
be also needed when the inherent practicability of
building new, well-planned towns, and of the population
moving into them from the old slum cities as naturally,
and, in proportion to the power to be exercised, almost
as easily as a family moves out of a rotten old tenement
into a new and comfortable dwelling, is once fairly recog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>nised
by the people. To build such towns, large areas
of land must be obtained. Here and there a suitable
site may be secured by arrangement with one or more
landowners, but if the movement is to be carried on in
anything like a scientific fashion, stretches of land far
larger than that occupied by our first experiment must
be obtained. For, just as the first short railway, which
was the germ of railway enterprise, would convey to few
minds the conception of a net-work of railways extending
over the whole country, so, perhaps, the idea of a well-planned
town such as I have described will not have
prepared the reader for the later development which
must inevitably follow&mdash;the planning and building of
town clusters&mdash;each town in the cluster being of different
design from the others, and yet the whole forming part
of one large and well-thought-out plan.</p>

<p>Let me here introduce a very rough diagram, representing,
as I conceive, the true principle on which all
towns should grow. Garden City has, we will suppose,
grown until it has reached a population of 32,000. How
shall it grow&mdash;How shall it provide for the needs of
others who will be attracted by its numerous advantages?
Shall it build on the zone of agricultural land which is
around it, and thus for ever destroy its right to be called
a “Garden City”? Surely not. This disastrous result
would indeed take place if the land around the town were,
as is the land around our present cities, owned by private
individuals anxious to make a profit out of it. For then,
as the town filled up, the agricultural land would become
“ripe” for building purposes, and the beauty and healthfulness
of the town would be quickly destroyed. But
the land around Garden City is, fortunately, not in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
hands of private individuals: it is in the hands of the
people: and is to be administered, not in the supposed
interests of the few, but in the real interests of the whole
community. Now, there are few objects which the
people so jealously guard as their parks and open spaces;
and we may, I think, feel confident that the people of
Garden City will not for a moment permit the beauty of
their city to be destroyed by the process of growth. But
it may be urged&mdash;If this be true, will not the inhabitants
of Garden City in this way be selfishly preventing the
growth of their city, and thus preclude many from enjoying
its advantages? Certainly not. There is a bright,
but overlooked, alternative. The town <i>will</i> grow; but it
will grow in accordance with a principle which will
result in this&mdash;that such growth shall not lessen or
destroy, but ever add to its social opportunities, to its
beauty, to its convenience. Consider for a moment the
case of a city in Australia which in some measure illustrates
the principle for which I am contending. The
city of Adelaide, as the accompanying sketch map shows,
is surrounded by its “Park Lands.” The city is built
up. How does it grow? It grows by leaping over the
“Park Lands” and establishing North Adelaide. And
this is the principle which it is intended to follow, but
improve upon, in Garden City.</p>

</a>
</div>

<p>Our diagram may now be understood. Garden City
is built up. Its population has reached 32,000. How
will it grow? It will grow by establishing&mdash;under Parliamentary
powers probably&mdash;another city some little
distance beyond its own zone of “country,” so that the
new town may have a zone of country of its own. I have
said “by establishing another city,” and, for administra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>tive
purposes there would be <i>two</i> cities; but the inhabitants
of the one could reach the other in a very few
minutes; for rapid transit would be specially provided
for, and thus the people of the two towns would in
reality represent one community.</p>

</a>
</div>

<p>And this principle of growth&mdash;this principle of always
preserving a belt of country round our cities would be
ever kept in mind till, in course of time, we should have
a cluster of cities, not of course arranged in the precise
geometrical form of my diagram, but so grouped around
a Central City that each inhabitant of the whole group,
though in one sense living in a town of small size, would
be in reality living in, and would enjoy all the advantages
of, a great and most beautiful city; and yet all the
fresh delights of the country&mdash;field, hedgerow, and wood-land&mdash;not
prim parks and gardens merely&mdash;would be
within a very few minutes walk or ride. And <i>because
the people in their collective capacity own the land</i> on
which this beautiful group of cities is built, the public
buildings, the churches, the schools and universities, the
libraries, picture galleries, theatres, would be on a scale
of magnificence which no city in the world whose land is
in pawn to private individuals can afford.</p>

<p>I have said that rapid railway transit would be
realised by those who dwell in this beautiful city or group
of cities. Reference to the diagram will show at a glance
the main features of its railway system. There is, first,
an inter-municipal railway connecting all the towns of the
outer ring&mdash;20 miles in circumference&mdash;so that to get
from any town to its most distant neighbour requires
one to cover a distance of only 10 miles, which could be
accomplished in, say, 12 minutes. These trains would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
not stop between the towns&mdash;means of communication
for this purpose being afforded by electric tramways
which traverse the high-roads, of which, it will be seen,
there are a number&mdash;each town being connected with
every other town in the group by a direct route.</p>

<p>There is also a system of railways by which each town
is placed in direct communication with Central City.
The distance from any town to the heart of Central City
is only 3&frac14; miles, and this could be readily covered in 5
minutes.</p>

<p>Those who have had experience of the difficulty of
getting from one suburb of London to another will see
in a moment what an enormous advantage those who
dwell in such a group of cities as here shown would enjoy,
because they would have a railway <i>system</i> and not a
railway <i>chaos</i> to serve their ends. The difficulty
felt in London is of course due to want of forethought
and pre-arrangement. On this point, I may quote
with advantage a passage from the Presidential address
of Sir Benjamin Baker to the Institute of Civil
Engineers, Nov. 12th, 1895: “We Londoners often complain
of the want of system in the arrangement of the
railways and their terminal stations in and around the
Metropolis, which necessitates our performing long
journeys in cabs to get from one railway system to
another. That this difficulty exists, arises, I feel sure,
chiefly from the want of forethought of no less able a
statesman than Sir Robert Peel, for, in 1836, a motion
was proposed in the House of Commons that all the
Railway Bills seeking powers for terminals in London
should be referred to a Special Committee, so that a
complete scheme might be evolved out of the numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
projects before Parliament, and that property might not
be unnecessarily sacrificed for rival schemes. Sir Robert
Peel opposed the motion on the part of the Government,
on the grounds that ‘no railway project could come into
operation till the majority of Parliament had declared
that its principles and arrangements appeared to them
satisfactory, and its investments profitable. It was a
recognised principle in these cases that the probable
profits of an undertaking should be shown to be sufficient
to maintain it in a state of permanent utility before
a Bill could be obtained, and landlords were perfectly
justified in expecting and demanding such a warranty
from Parliament.’ In this instance, incalculable injury
was unintentionally inflicted upon Londoners by not
having a grand central station in the Metropolis, and
events have shown how false was the assumption that
the passing of an Act implied any warranty as to the
financial prospects of a railway.”</p>

<p>But are the people of England to suffer for ever for
the want of foresight of those who little dreamed of the
future development of railways? Surely not. It was in
the nature of things little likely that the first network
of railways ever constructed should conform to true
principles; but now, seeing the enormous progress which
has been made in the means of rapid communication, it
is high time that we availed ourselves more fully of those
means, and built our cities upon some such plan as that
I have crudely shown. We should then be, for all purposes
of quick communication, nearer to each other than
we are in our crowded cities, while, at the same time, we
should be surrounding ourselves with the most healthy
and the most advantageous conditions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of my friends have suggested that such a scheme
of town clusters is well enough adapted to a new country,
but that in an old-settled country, with its towns built,
and its railway “system” for the most part constructed,
it is quite a different matter. But surely to raise such a
point is to contend, in other words, that the existing
wealth forms of the country are permanent, and are forever
to serve as hindrances to the introduction of better
forms; that crowded, ill-ventilated, unplanned, unwieldy,
unhealthy cities&mdash;ulcers on the very face of our beautiful
island&mdash;are to stand as barriers to the introduction of
towns in which modern scientific methods and the aims of
social reformers may have the fullest scope in which to
express themselves. No, it cannot be; at least, it cannot
be for long. What Is may hinder What Might Be for
a while, but cannot stay the tide of progress. These
crowded cities have done their work; they were the best
which a society largely based on selfishness and rapacity
could construct, but they are in the nature of things entirely
unadapted for a society in which the social side of
our nature is demanding a larger share of recognition&mdash;a
society where even the very love of self leads us to insist
upon a greater regard for the well-being of our fellows.
The large cities of to-day are scarcely better adapted for
the expression of the fraternal spirit than would a work
on astronomy which taught that the earth was the centre
of the universe be capable of adaptation for use in our
schools. Each generation should build to suit its own
needs; and it is no more in the nature of things that men
should continue to live in old areas because their ancestors
lived in them, than it is that they should cherish
the old beliefs which a wider faith and a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
enlarged understanding have outgrown. The reader is,
therefore, earnestly asked not to take it for granted that
the large cities in which he may perhaps take a pardonable
pride are necessarily, in their present form, any
more permanent than the stage-coach system which was
the subject of so much admiration just at the very
moment when it was about to be supplanted by the railways.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
The simple issue to be faced, and faced resolutely,
is&mdash;Can better results be obtained by starting on a bold
plan on comparatively virgin soil than by attempting to
adapt our old cities to our newer and higher needs?
Thus fairly faced, the question can only be answered in
one way; and when that simple fact is well grasped, the
social revolution will speedily commence.</p>

<p>That there is ample land in this country on which
such a cluster as I have here depicted could be constructed
with <i>comparatively</i> small disturbance of vested
interests, and, therefore, with but little need for compensation,
will be obvious to anyone; and, when our
first experiment has been brought to a successful issue,
there will be no great difficulty in acquiring the necessary
Parliamentary powers to purchase the land and carry out
the necessary works step by step. County Councils are
now seeking larger powers, and an overburdened Parliament
is becoming more and more anxious to devolve some
of its duties upon them. Let such powers be given more
and more freely. Let larger and yet larger measures of
local self-government be granted, and then all that my
diagram depicts&mdash;only on a far better plan, because the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
result of well-concerted and combined thought,&mdash;will be
easily attainable.</p>

<p>But it may be said, “Are you not, by thus frankly
avowing the very great danger to the vested interests of
this country which your scheme indirectly threatens,
arming vested interests against yourself, and so making
any change by legislation impossible?” I think not.
And for three reasons. First, because those vested
interests which are said to be ranged like a solid phalanx
against progress, will, by the force of circumstances and
the current of events, be for once divided into opposing
camps. Secondly, because property owners, who are very
reluctant to yield to threats, such as are sometimes
made against them by Socialists of a certain type, will
be far more ready to make concessions to the logic of
events as revealing itself in an undoubted advance of
society to a higher form; and, thirdly, because the largest
and most important, and, in the end, the most influential
of all vested interests&mdash;I mean the vested interests of
those who work for their living, whether by hand or
brain&mdash;will be naturally in favour of the change when
they understand its nature.</p>

<p>Let me deal with these points separately. First, I
say vested-property interests will be broken in twain,
and will range themselves in opposite camps. This sort
of cleavage has occurred before. Thus, in the early days
of railway legislation, the vested interests in canals and
stage coaches were alarmed, and did all in their power
to thwart and hamper what threatened them. But other
great vested interests brushed this opposition easily on
one side. These interests were chiefly two&mdash;capital
seeking investment, and land desiring to sell itself. (A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
third vested interest&mdash;namely, labour seeking employment&mdash;had
then scarcely begun to assert its claims.)
And notice now how such a successful experiment as
Garden City may easily become will drive into the
very bed-rock of vested interests a great wedge, which
will split them asunder with irresistible force, and
permit the current of legislation to set strongly in a new
direction. For what will such an experiment have proved
up to the very hilt? Among other things too numerous
to mention, it will have proved that far more healthy and
economic conditions can be secured on raw uncultivated
land (if only that land be held on just conditions) than
can be secured on land which is at present of vastly higher
market value; and in proving this it will open wide the
doors of migration from the old crowded cities with their
inflated and artificial rents, back to the land which can
be now secured so cheaply. Two tendencies will then
display themselves. The first will be a strong tendency
for city ground values to fall, the other a less marked
tendency for agricultural land to rise.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The holders of
agricultural land, at least those who are willing to sell&mdash;and
many of them are even now most anxious to do so&mdash;will
welcome the extension of an experiment which promises
to place English agriculture once again in a position
of prosperity: the holders of city lands will, so far
as their merely selfish interests prevail, greatly fear it.
In this way, landowners throughout the country will be
divided into two opposing factions, and the path of land
reform&mdash;the foundation on which all other reforms must
be built&mdash;will be made comparatively easy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>
<p>Capital in the same way will be divided into opposite
camps. Invested capital&mdash;that is, capital sunk in enterprises
which society will recognise as belonging to the old
order&mdash;will take the alarm and fall in value enormously,
while, on the other hand, capital seeking investment will
welcome an outlet which has long been its sorest need.
Invested capital will in its opposition be further
weakened by another consideration. Holders of existing
forms of capital will strive&mdash;even though it be at a great
sacrifice&mdash;to sell part of their old time-honoured stocks,
and invest them in new enterprises, on municipally-owned
land, for they will not wish to “have all their eggs in
one basket”; and thus will the opposing influences of
vested property neutralise each other.</p>

<p>But vested-property interests will be, as I believe,
affected yet more remarkably in another way. The man
of wealth, when he is personally attacked and denounced
as an enemy of society, is slow to believe in the perfect
good faith of those who denounce him, and, when efforts
are made to tax him out by the forcible hand of the
State, he is apt to use every endeavour, lawful or
unlawful, to oppose such efforts&mdash;and often with no
small measure of success. But the average wealthy man
is no more an unmixed compound of selfishness than the
average poor man; and if he sees his houses or lands
depreciated in value, not by force, but because those who
lived in or upon them have learned how to erect far
better homes of their own, and on land held on conditions
more advantageous to them, and to surround their
children with many advantages which cannot be enjoyed
on his estate, he will philosophically bow to the inevitable,
and, in his better moments, even welcome a change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
which will involve him in far greater pecuniary loss
than any change in the incidence of taxation is likely to
inflict. In every man there is some measure of the
reforming instinct; in every man there is some regard
for his fellows; and when these natural feelings run
athwart his pecuniary interests, then the result is that
the spirit of opposition is inevitably softened, in some
degree in all men, while in others it is entirely replaced
by a fervent desire for the country’s good, even at the
sacrifice of many cherished possessions. Thus it is that
what will not be yielded to a force from without may
readily be granted as the result of an impulse from
within.</p>

<p>And now let me deal for a moment with the
greatest, the most valuable, and the most permanent of
all vested interests&mdash;the vested interests of skill, labour,
energy, talent, industry. How will these be affected?
My answer is, The force which will divide in twain the
vested interests of land and capital will unite and consolidate
the interests of those who live by work, and will
lead them to unite their forces with the holders of agricultural
land and of capital seeking investment, to urge
upon the State the necessity for the prompt opening up
of facilities for the reconstruction of society; and, when
the State is slow to act, then to employ voluntary collective
efforts similar to those adopted in the Garden City
experiment, with such modifications as experience may
show to be necessary. Such a task as the construction
of a cluster of cities like that represented in our diagram
may well inspire all workers with that enthusiasm which
unites men, for it will call for the very highest talents of
engineers of all kinds, of architects, artists, medical men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
experts in sanitation, landscape gardeners, agricultural
experts, surveyors, builders, manufacturers, merchants
and financiers, organisers of trades unions, friendly and
co-operative societies, as well as the very simplest forms
of unskilled labour, together with all those forms of lesser
skill and talent which lie between. For the vastness of
the task which seems to frighten some of my friends,
represents, in fact, the very measure of its value to the
community, if that task be only undertaken in a worthy
spirit and with worthy aims. Work in abundance is, as
has been several times urged, one of the greatest needs of
to-day, and no such field of employment has been opened
up since civilisation began as would be represented by the
task which is before us of reconstructing anew the entire
external fabric of society, employing, as we build, all the
skill and knowledge which the experience of centuries
has taught us. It was “a large order” which was presented
in the early part of this century to construct iron
highways throughout the length and breadth of this
island, uniting in a vast network all its towns and cities.
But railway enterprise, vast as has been its influence,
touched the life of the people at but few points compared
with the newer call to build home-towns for slum cities;
to plant gardens for crowded courts; to construct beautiful
water-ways in flooded valleys; to establish a scientific
system of distribution to take the place of a chaos, a just
system of land tenure for one representing the selfishness
which we hope is passing away; to found pensions with
liberty for our aged poor, now imprisoned in workhouses;
to banish despair and awaken hope in the breasts of
those who have fallen; to silence the harsh voice of
anger, and to awaken the soft notes of brotherliness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
goodwill; to place in strong hands implements of peace
and construction, so that implements of war and destruction
may drop uselessly down. Here is a task which may
well unite a vast army of workers to utilise that power,
the present waste of which is the source of half our
poverty, disease, and suffering.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<span class="smaller">THE FUTURE OF LONDON.</span></h2>


<p>It will now be interesting to consider some of the more
striking effects which will be produced on our now over-crowded
cities by the opening-up in new districts of such
a vast field of employment as the reader’s mind will, it is
hoped, be now able to realise with some degree of clearness.
New towns and groups of towns are springing up
in parts of our islands hitherto well-nigh deserted; new
means of communication, the most scientific the world
has yet seen, are being constructed; new means of distribution
are bringing the producer and the consumer
into closer relations, and thus (by reducing railway rates
and charges, and the number of profits) are at once
raising prices to the producer and diminishing them to
the consumer; parks and gardens, orchards and woods,
are being planted in the midst of the busy life of the
people, so that they may be enjoyed in the fullest measure;
homes are being erected for those who have long
lived in slums; work is found for the workless, land
for the landless, and opportunities for the expenditure of
long pent-up energy are presenting themselves at every
turn. A new sense of freedom and joy is pervading the
hearts of the people as their individual faculties are
awakened, and they discover, in a social life which
permits alike of the completest concerted action and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the fullest individual liberty, the long-sought-for means
of reconciliation between order and freedom&mdash;between
the well-being of the individual and of society.</p>

<p>The effects produced on our over-crowded cities,
whose forms are at once, by the light of a new contrast,
seen to be old-fashioned and effete, will be so far-reaching
in their character that, in order to study them effectively,
it will be well to confine our attention to London, which,
as the largest and most unwieldy of our cities, is likely to
exhibit those effects in the most marked degree.</p>

<p>There is, as I said at the outset, a well-nigh universal
current of opinion that a remedy for the depopulation of
our country districts and for the overcrowding of our large
cities is urgently needed. But though every one recommends
that a remedy should be diligently sought for, few
appear to believe that such a remedy will ever be found,
and the calculations of our statesmen and reformers
proceed upon the assumption that not only will the tide
of population never actually turn from the large cities
countryward, but that it will continue to flow in its
present direction at a scarcely diminished rate for a long
time to come.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Now it can hardly be supposed that any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
search made in the full belief that the remedy sought for
will not be discovered is likely to be carried on with great
zeal or thoroughness; and, therefore, it is perhaps not
surprising to find that though the late chairman of the
London County Council (Lord Rosebery) declared that
the growth of this huge city was fitly comparable to the
growth of a tumour (<i>see</i> p. 11)&mdash;few venturing to deny the
correctness of the analogy&mdash;yet the various members of
that body, instead of bending their energies to reforming
London by means of a reduction of its population, are
boldly advocating a policy which involves the purchase
of vast undertakings on behalf of the municipality, at
prices which must prove far higher than they will be
worth if only the long-sought-for remedy is found.</p>

<p>Let us now assume (simply as an hypothesis, if the
reader is still sceptical) that the remedy advocated in
this work is effective; that new garden-cities are springing
up all over the country on sites owned by the
municipalities&mdash;the rate-rents of such corporate property
forming a fund ample for the carrying on of municipal
undertakings representing the highest skill of the modern
engineer and the best aspirations of the enlightened reformer;
and that in these cities, healthier, wholesomer,
cleaner and more just and sound economic conditions prevail.
What, then, must in the nature of things be the
more noticeable effects upon London and the population
of London; upon its land values; upon its municipal
debt, and its municipal assets; upon London as a labour
market; upon the homes of its people; upon its open
spaces, and upon the great undertakings which our
socialistic and municipal reformers are at the present
moment so anxious to secure?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>First, notice that ground values will fall enormously!
Of course, so long as the 121 square miles out of the
58,000 square miles of England exercise a magnetic
attraction so great as to draw to it one-fifth of the whole
population, who compete fiercely with each other for the
right to occupy the land within that small area, so long
will that land have a monopoly price. But de-magnetise
that people, convince large numbers of them that they
can better their condition in every way by migrating
elsewhere, and what becomes of that monopoly value?
Its spell is broken, and the great bubble bursts.</p>

<p>But the life and earnings of Londoners are not only
in pawn to the owners of its soil, who kindly permit them
to live upon it at enormous rents&mdash;£16,000,000 per
annum, representing the present ground value of
London, which is yearly increasing; but they are also in
pawn to the extent of about £40,000,000, representing
London’s municipal debts.</p>

<p>But notice this. A municipal debtor is quite
different from an ordinary debtor in one most important
respect. <i>He can escape payment by migration.</i> He has
but to move away from a given municipal area, and he at
once, <i>ipso facto</i>, shakes off not only all his obligations to
his landlord, but also all his obligations to his municipal
creditors. It is true, when he migrates he must assume
the burden of a new municipal rent, and of a new
municipal debt; but these in our new cities will
represent an extremely small and diminishing fraction of
the burden now borne, and the temptation to migrate
will, for this and many other reasons, be extremely
strong.</p>

<p>But now let us notice how each person in migrating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
from London, while making the burden of <i>ground-rents</i>
less heavy for those who remain, will (unless
there be some change in the law), make the burden
of <i>rates</i> on the ratepayers of London yet heavier. For,
though each person in migrating will enable those who
remain to make better and yet better terms with their
landlords; on the other hand, the municipal debt remaining
the same, the interest on it will have to be borne
by fewer and yet fewer people, and thus the relief to the
working population which comes from <i>reduced rent</i> will
be largely discounted by <i>increased rates</i>, and in this way
the temptation to migrate will continue, and yet further
population will remove, making the debt ever a larger
and larger burden, till at length, though accompanied
by a still further reduction of rent, it may become intolerable.
Of course this huge debt need never have
been incurred. Had London been built on municipally-owned
land, its rents would not only have easily provided
for all current expenditure, without any need for a levy
of rates or for incurring loans for long periods, but it
would have been enabled to own its own water-supply
and many other useful and profit-bearing undertakings,
instead of being in its present position with vast debts
and small assets. But a vicious and immoral system is
bound ultimately to snap, and when the breaking-point
is reached, the owners of London’s bonds will, like the
owners of London’s land, have to make terms with a
people who can apply the simple remedy of migrating
and building a better and brighter civilisation elsewhere,
if they are not allowed to rebuild on a just and reasonable
basis on the site of their ancient city.</p>

<p>We may next notice, very briefly, the bearing of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
migration of population upon two great problems&mdash;the
problem of the housing of the people of London, and the
problem of finding employment for those who remain.
The rents now paid by the working population of
London, for accommodation most miserable and insufficient,
represents each year a larger and larger proportion
of income, while the cost of moving to and from
work, continually increasing, often represents in time
and money a very considerable tax. But imagine the
population of London falling, and falling rapidly; the
migrating people establishing themselves where rents are
extremely low, and where their work is within easy-walking
distance of their homes! Obviously, house-property
in London will fall in rental value, and fall
enormously. Slum property will sink to zero, and the
whole working population will move into houses of a
class quite above those which they can now afford to
occupy. Families which are now compelled to huddle
together in one room will be able to rent five or six, and
thus will the housing problem temporarily solve itself by
the simple process of a diminution in the numbers of
the tenants.</p>

<p>But what will become of this slum property? Its
power to extort a large proportion of the hard earnings
of the London poor gone for ever, will it yet remain an
eye-sore and a blot, though no longer a danger to health
and an outrage on decency? No. These wretched slums
will be pulled down, and their sites occupied by parks,
recreation grounds, and allotment gardens. And this
change, as well as many others, will be effected, not at
the expense of the ratepayers, but almost entirely at the
expense of the landlord class: in this sense, at least, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
such ground rents as are still paid by the people of
London in respect of those classes of property which
retain some rental value will have to bear the burden of
improving the city. Nor will, I think, the compulsion of
any Act of Parliament be necessary to effect this result:
it will probably be achieved by the voluntary action of
the landowners, compelled, by a Nemesis from whom
there is no escape, to make some restitution for the great
injustice which they have so long committed.</p>

<p>For observe what must inevitably happen. A vast
field of employment being opened outside London, unless
a corresponding field of employment is opened within it,
London must die,&mdash;when the landowners will be in a sorry
plight. Elsewhere new cities are being built: London
then must be transformed. Elsewhere the town is invading
the country: here the country must invade the town.
Elsewhere cities are being built on the terms of paying
low prices for land, and of then vesting such land in the
new municipalities: in London corresponding arrangements
must be made or no one will consent to build.
Elsewhere, owing to the fact that there are but few
interests to buy out, improvements of all kinds can go
forward rapidly and scientifically: in London similar
improvements can only be carried out if vested interests
recognise the inevitable and accept terms which may
seem ridiculous, but are no more so than those which a
manufacturer often finds himself compelled to submit to,
who sells for a ridiculously low price the machine which
has cost a very large sum, for the simple reason that
there is a far better one in the market, and that it no
longer <i>pays</i>, in the face of keen competition, to work the
inferior machine. The displacement of capital will, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
doubt, be enormous, but the implacement of labour will
be yet greater. A few may be made comparatively poor,
but the many will be made comparatively rich&mdash;a very
healthy change, the slight evils attending which society
will be well able to mitigate.</p>

<p>There are already visible symptoms of the coming
change&mdash;rumblings which precede the earthquake.
London at this very moment may be said to be on strike
against its landowners. Long-desired London improvements
are awaiting such a change in the law as will throw
some of the cost of making them upon the landowners
of London. Railways are projected, but in some cases
are not built&mdash;for instance, The Epping Forest Railway&mdash;because
the London County Council, most properly
anxious to keep down the fares by workmen’s trains,
press for and secure, at the hands of a Parliamentary
Committee, the imposition of terms upon the promoters
which seem to them extremely onerous and unremunerative,
but which would pay the company extremely well
were it not for the prohibitive price asked for land and
other property along the line of its projected route.
These checks upon enterprise must affect the growth of
London even now, and make it less rapid than it otherwise
would be; but when the untold treasures of our
land are unlocked, and when the people now living in
London discover how easily vested interests, without
being attacked, may be circumvented, then the landowners
of London and those who represent other vested
interests had better quickly make terms, or London,
besides being what Mr. Grant Allen termed “a squalid
village,” will also become a deserted one.</p>

<p>But better counsels, let us hope, will prevail, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
new city rise on the ashes of the old. The task will
indeed be difficult. Easy, comparatively, is it to lay out
on virgin soil the plan of a magnificent city, such as
represented on our Diagram 5. Of far greater difficulty
is the problem&mdash;even if all vested interests freely effaced
themselves&mdash;of rebuilding a new city on an old site, and
that site occupied by a huge population. But this, at
least, is certain, that the present area of the London
County Council ought not (if health and beauty, and
that which is too frequently put in the front rank&mdash;rapid
production of wealth forms&mdash;are to be considered)
to contain more than, say, one-fifth of its present population;
and that new systems of railways, sewerage,
drainage, lighting, parks, etc., must be constructed if
London is to be saved, while the whole system of production
and of distribution must undergo changes as complete
and as remarkable as was the change from a system
of barter to our present complicated commercial system.</p>

<p>Proposals for the reconstruction of London have
already been projected. In 1883 the late Mr. William
Westgarth offered the Society of Arts the sum of £1,200
to be awarded in prizes for essays on the best means of
providing dwellings for the London poor, and on the reconstruction
of Central London&mdash;an offer which brought
forward several schemes of some boldness.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> More
recently a book by Mr. Arthur Cawston, entitled “A
Comprehensive Scheme for Street Improvements in
London,” was published by Stanford, which contains in
its introduction the following striking passage:&mdash;“The
literature relating to London, extensive as it is, contains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
no work which aims at the solution of one problem of vast
interest to Londoners. They are beginning to realise,
partly by their more and more extensive travels, and
partly through their American and foreign critics, that
the gigantic growth of their capital, without the controlling
guidance of a municipality, has resulted in not
only the biggest, but in probably the most irregular, inconvenient,
and unmethodical collection of houses in the
world. A comprehensive plan for the transformation of
Paris has been gradually developed since 1848; slums
have disappeared from Berlin since 1870; eighty-eight
acres in the centre of Glasgow have been remodelled;
Birmingham has transformed ninety-three acres of squalid
slums into magnificent streets flanked by architectural
buildings; Vienna, having completed her stately outer
ring, is about to remodel her inner city: and the aim of
the writer is to show, by example and illustration, in
what way the means successfully employed for improving
these cities can be best adapted to the needs of London.”</p>

<p>The time for the complete reconstruction of London&mdash;which
will eventually take place on a far more comprehensive
scale than that now exhibited in Paris, Berlin,
Glasgow, Birmingham, or Vienna&mdash;has, however, not yet
come. A simpler problem must first be solved. One
small Garden City must be built as a working model,
and then a group of cities such as that dealt with in the
last chapter. These tasks done, and done well, the reconstruction
of London must inevitably follow, and the
power of vested interests to block the way will have been
almost, if not entirely, removed.</p>

<p>Let us, therefore, first bend all our energies to the
smaller of these tasks, thinking only of the larger tasks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
which lie beyond as incentives to a determined line of
immediate action, and as a means of realising the great
value of little things if done in the right manner and in
the right spirit.</p>

<h2>POSTSCRIPT.</h2>


<p>“To-Morrow,” of which this book is substantially a
reproduction, having been published towards the end of
1898, the reader who has followed me thus far will be
interested to learn what has been done, and what is proposed
to be done to realise the project which was there
set forth. I will endeavour to answer these questions.</p>

<p>At the outset, I perceived that the first thing was to
make the project widely known&mdash;that the city which was
pictured so vividly in my own mind must be pictured
more or less vividly by many, and that a strong and
widespread desire for its up-rearing must be created
before a single step could be wisely taken to put the
project in a concrete form. For the task before me was,
I was fully conscious, a most difficult one, and demanded
the hearty co-operation of men and of women<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> experienced
in very numerous departments of human
activity; and many of these had to be reached and
enlisted. City building, as a deliberately thought-out
enterprise, is indeed a lost art, in this country at least,
and this art has not only to be revived, but has to be
carried to finer issues than those who have before
practised it ever dreamt of. Autocrats like Alexander
the Great and Philip II. could build cities according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
well-thought out and carefully-matured plans, because
they could impose their will by force; but a city which
is to be the outward expression of a strong desire to
secure the best interests of all its inhabitants can, among
a self-governing people, only arise as the outcome of
much patient and well-sustained effort. Moreover, the
building of the first of such cities necessarily involves
co-operation on new lines&mdash;in untried ways; and, as it is
essential that the freedom of the individual as well as
the interests of the community should be preserved, very
much work must needs be done to prepare the way for
the successful launching of such an experiment.</p>

<p>My task&mdash;hardly a self-imposed one, for, when I commenced
my investigations many years ago, I little
dreamed where they would lead me&mdash;was rendered
especially difficult by the nature of my professional
work, which it was impossible for me to give up; and I
could, therefore, only give odds and ends of time and
energies largely exhausted to the work. But, fortunately,
I was not left without help. First the press
came to my aid. “To-Morrow” was very widely noticed.
Many books have been more fully reviewed, but few have
been noticed, and favourably noticed, in such a variety
of types of journals as “To-Morrow” has been. Besides
the daily and weekly papers of London and the provinces,
the project has been favourably commented upon
in journals representing widely different points of view.
I may mention, merely as illustrations of this&mdash;“Commerce,”
“Country Gentleman,” “Spectator,”
“Leisure Hour,” “Court Circular,” “Clarion,”
“Builder’s Journal,” “Commonwealth,” “Young Man,”
“Councillor and Guardian,” “Ladies’ Pictorial,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
“Public Health Engineer,” “Municipal Journal,”
“Argus,” “Vegetarian,” “Journal of Gas Lighting,”
“Labour Copartnership,” “Hospital,” “Brotherhood,”
“Municipal Reformer.”</p>

<p>Nor was the reason of this widespread interest
difficult to discover. The project, indeed, touches life at
every point, and when once carried out will be an object-lesson
which must have far-reaching and beneficial
results.</p>

<p>But, although approval of my aims was general,
doubts were often, especially at first, expressed as to
their realisability. Thus, the “Times” said: “The
details of administration, taxation, etc., work out to
perfection. The only difficulty is to create the city, but
that is a small matter to Utopians.” If this be so, then,
by the “Times’” own showing, I am no Utopian, for to
me the building of the city is what I have long set my
mind upon, and it is with me no “small matter.” A few
months after this, however, the “Journal of Gas Lighting”
put my case very forcibly thus: “Why should the
creation of a town be an insuperable difficulty. It is
nothing of the kind. Materials for a tentative realisation
of Mr Howard’s ideal city exist in abundance in
London at the present moment. Time and again it is
announced that some London firm have transferred their
factory to Rugby, or Dunstable, or High Wycombe for
business reasons. It ought not to be impossible to
systematise this movement and give the old country
some new towns in which intelligent design shall direct
the social workings of economic forces.”</p>

<p>In my spare time I lectured on the Garden City,
the first lecture after publication being given in Decem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>ber,
1898, at the Rectory Road Congregational Church,
Stoke Newington, N. In the chair was Mr. T. E. Young,
past President, Institute of Actuaries, and I was supported
also by Dr. Forman, A.L.C.C.; Rev. C. Fleming
Williams, A.L.C.C.; Mr. James Branch, L.C.C.; and Mr.
Lampard, L.C.C. The lecture was well reported in a
local journal, and I speedily found that, by means of
lectures, interest in the project could be widened,
because the subject made “good copy.” I, therefore, as
far as possible, have always given lectures when requested,
and have spoken in London, Glasgow, Manchester,
and many provincial towns. Friends, too, began
to help, the Rev. J. Bruce Wallace, M.A., of Brotherhood
Church being among the first to lecture upon the
project; nor shall I ever forget the pleasure I felt at
hearing his simple and forcible exposition of it.</p>

<p>Soon after the publication of “To-Morrow,” I began
to receive many letters, and these often from business
men. One of the first of these was from Mr. W. R. Bootland,
of Daisy Bank Mills, Newchurch, near Warrington,
who wrote heartily commending the project as
“sound business,” and yet as likely to confer great public
benefits.</p>

<p>After a few months of such fitful work as I could
undertake, I consulted a friend, Mr F. W. Flear, and
we decided it would be well to form an Association
with a view to securing supporters in a more systematic
manner, and of formulating the scheme more completely,
so that, at as early a date as possible, a suitable organisation
might be created for carrying it out. Accordingly,
on the 10th June, 1899, a few friends met at the offices
of Mr. Alexander W. Payne, Chartered Accountant, 70<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Finsbury Pavement, E.C., Mr Fred. Bishop, of Tunbridge
Wells, in the chair, and the Garden City Association
was formed&mdash;Mr. Payne being its first Hon.
Treasurer, and Mr. F. W. Steere, a barrister, who had
written a very useful summary of “To-Morrow” in
<i>Uses</i>, its first Hon. Secretary. On the 21st of the
same month, a public meeting was held at the Memorial
Hall, Farringdon Street, E.C., which was presided over
by Sir John Leng, M.P., who, at a very short notice, gave
an interesting outline of the project, and urged those
present to support me in my very difficult task. At this
meeting a Council was formed, and at the first sittings
of that body Mr. T.H.W. Idris, J.P., L.C.C., was elected
chairman, a post which he resigned at a later stage on
account of ill-health, though remaining as firmly convinced
as ever of the soundness of the Garden City idea.</p>

<p>Lecturers now began to come forward in different
parts of the country, and additional interest was afforded
by lantern slides and diagrams. The Association
steadily grew, and three months after its formation I was
able to write to the “Citizen”:&mdash;“The Association
numbers amongst its members, Manufacturers, Co-operators,
Architects, Artists, Medical Men, Financial
Experts, Lawyers, Merchants, Ministers of Religion,
Members of the L.C.C., Moderate and Progressive;
Socialists and Individuals, Radicals and Conservatives.”</p>

<p>Our subscriptions, however, were very small. We
had put the minimum at the democratic shilling, so that
none should be shut out, but, unfortunately, some who
could afford much more were content to subscribe that
sum, and, from the formation of the Association until
August 13, 1901&mdash;a little more than two years&mdash;the total<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
subscriptions to the general funds of the Association only
reached £241 13s. 9d.</p>

<p>A change suddenly came over the Association. I
learned early in 1901 that Mr. Ralph Neville, K.C., had
written in “Labour Copartnership” expressing his full
approval of the essential principles of the Garden City
project, and when I called upon him he at once consented
to join our Council, and, shortly afterwards, was unanimously
elected its chairman. At about the same time,
though our financial position hardly justified such a
step, we took an office of our own, and engaged a paid
secretary, who agreed to devote his whole time to the
work.</p>

<p>And here the Garden City Association was very
fortunate. It secured the services of Mr. Thomas
Adams, a young Scotchman, who has proved active,
energetic, and resourceful&mdash;to whose suggestion was due
the Conference held last September at Mr. Cadbury’s
beautiful village of Bournville, which has done more
than anything else to make the Garden City Association
and its project known to the great public, and to give
to our members ocular proof of the feasibility&mdash;indeed,
the wonderful success&mdash;of a scheme in so many respects
like our own.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Since our Annual Meeting in December our membership
has increased&mdash;thanks mainly to a special effort of
members&mdash;from 530 to 1,300; and, as many of our
friends, anxious to put the project to the test of experiment
at an early date, are offering to subscribe very considerable
sums, a Joint Stock Company, to be called the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Garden City Pioneer Company, Limited, with a small
capital of about £20,000, is being formed for the purpose
of securing the option of a site, and of preparing and
presenting to the public a complete scheme adapted to
the development of the site thus selected&mdash;a scheme
which will be in accordance with the general principles
set forth in this book, but differing, of course, in many
details. Subscribers to this preliminary Company will,
of course, run considerable risk; and, as the profits, even
in the event of the most complete success, will only be
nominal, the appeal will be addressed only to those who
take an interest in the project as public-spirited citizens.
The Secretary of the Garden City Association will give
the latest information on this subject, and will also
gladly enrol members.</p>

<p>No one can possibly be under a greater obligation
than he who has an idea which he earnestly wishes to see
carried out and who finds others helping him to make
visible that which exists only as a thought. Under this
greatest of debts am I. By writing; by speaking; by
organising public meetings and drawing-room meetings;
by suggestion, encouragement, and advice; by secretarial
and other work; by making the project known among
their friends; by subscribing funds for propaganda
work; and, now, by offering to subscribe considerable
sums for practical steps, many have helped and are
helping me to do that which, without their aid, must
have been quite impossible. They have thus multiplied
my strength a thousandfold; and from the very bottom
of my heart I thank them for the assurance of speedy
success which their efforts have thus given me. Ere
long, I trust we shall meet in Garden City.</p>

<h3>Objects.</h3>

<p>To promote the discussion of the project suggested by
Mr. Ebenezer Howard in “To-morrow”<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>, and ultimately
to formulate a practical scheme on the lines of that project,
with such modifications as may appear desirable.</p>


<h3>Membership.</h3>

<p>Payment of an Annual Subscription of not less than 1s.
confers Membership. A Subscription of 2s. 6d., or more,
entitles the Subscriber to all literature published by the
Association. More funds are required for the immediate
purpose of bringing our proposals prominently before the
public, and an average subscription of 5s. per member is
necessary to meet current expenditure. The income for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the first half year 1901-02 was ten times that of the same
period of the previous year. The Membership is over
1,300, being an increase of 700 since January 1st, 1902.
It is hoped that all who are desirous of improving, by
constitutional means, the present physical, social, and industrial
conditions of life in town and country, will help to
immediately increase this number.</p>


<h3>Sectional Committees.</h3>

<p>Committees have been or are being appointed to consider
questions of detail, such as Land Tenure, Manufactures
and Trade, Co-operative Societies, Labour, Housing
and Public Health, Liquor Traffic, Education, Smoke
Abatement, Art, etc. Members desirous of taking part in
the work of any section are requested to communicate with
the General Secretary.</p>


<h3>Publications.</h3>

<p>The Association publishes a number of tracts which are
forwarded to members on joining. A list of publications
and some explanatory literature will be sent free on application.
A few reports of the Bournville Conference may
still be had, price 6d., post free. These reports consist of
80 pages, and contain reports of speeches by&mdash;Earl Grey,
Mr. Ralph Neville, K.C.; Mr. George Cadbury, Mr.
Aneurin Williams, the Mayor of Camberwell, Sir M. M.
Bhownaggree, M.P.; Mr. R. B. Martin, M.P.; Mr.
Ebenezer Howard, Dr. Mansfield Robinson, and others.</p>

Council of Derbyshire, giving evidence before a Select Committee
of the House of Commons, on 25th April, 1894, on the
Chesterfield Gas and Water Bill, said, in answer to Question
1873: “At Brimington Common School I saw some basins full
of soapsuds, and it was all the water that the whole of the
children had to wash in. They had to wash one after another
in the same water. Of course, a child with ringworm or something
of that kind might spread it through the whole of the
children.... The schoolmistress told me that the children
came in from the playground hot, and she had seen them
actually drink this dirty water. In fact, when they were
thirsty there was no other water for them to have.”</p></div>

unity of design, and at the chance discretion of any persons
who were fortunate enough to own land as it came into demand
at successive periods for building operations. Sometimes a
great landlord laid out a quarter in a manner to tempt the
better class of residents by squares, gardens, or retired streets,
often cut off from through traffic by gates and bars; but even
in these cases London as a whole has not been thought of, and
no main arteries have been provided for. In other and more
frequent cases of small landowners, the only design of builders
has been to crowd upon the land as many streets and houses as
possible, regardless of anything around them, and without open
spaces or wide approaches. A careful examination of a map of
London shows how absolutely wanting in any kind of plan has
been its growth, and how little the convenience and wants of
the whole population or the considerations of dignity and
beauty have been consulted.”&mdash;Right Hon. G. J. Shaw-Lefevre,

“that there are 41,735 separate establishments for
22 of the principal retail trades in London. If for each of these
trades there were 648 shops&mdash;that is 9 to the square mile, no
one would have to go more than a quarter of a mile to the
nearest shop. There would be 14,256 shops in all. Assuming
that this supply would be sufficient, there are in London 251
shops for every hundred that are really wanted. The general
prosperity of the country will be much increased when the
capital and labour that are now wastefully employed in the
retail trade are set free for other work.”&mdash;“Economics of Industry,”

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> This principle of local option, which is chiefly applicable to
distributive callings, is perhaps applicable to production in
some of its branches. Thus bakeries and laundries, which
would largely depend upon the trade of the locality, seem to
present instances where it might with some caution be applied.
Few businesses seem to require more thorough supervision and
control than these, and few have a more direct relation to
health. Indeed, a very strong case might be made out for
municipal bakeries and municipal laundries, and it is evident
that the control of an industry by the community is a half-way
house to its assumption of it, should this prove desirable and
practicable.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> Since “To-Morrow” was published, various Companies
have been formed by the Public House Trust Association,
116 Victoria Street, Westminster, S.W., with the object of
carrying on the trade on principles advocated by the Bishop
of Chester. A limited dividend of 5 per cent. is fixed; all
profits beyond are expended in useful public enterprises, and
the Managers have no interest whatever in pushing the trade
in intoxicating liquors. It may be interesting also to observe
that Mr. George Cadbury, in the Deed of Foundation of the
Bourneville Trust, provides for the complete restriction of
the traffic at the outset. But as a practical man, he sees that
as the Trust grows (and its power of growth is among its most
admirable features) it may be necessary to remove such complete
restrictions. And he provides that in that event “all the net
profits arising from the sale and co-operative distribution of
intoxicating liquors shall be devoted to securing recreation
and counter attractions to the liquor trade as ordinarily conducted.”</p></div>

enough to grasp the banner of a new truth, and endurance
enough to bear it along rugged and untrodden ways.... To
insist on a whole community being made at once to submit to
the reign of new practices and new ideas which have just begun
to commend themselves to the most advanced speculative intelligence
of the time&mdash;this, even if it were a possible process,
would do much to make life impracticable and to hurry on
social dissolution.... A new social state can never establish
its ideas unless the persons who hold them confess them
openly and give them an honest and effective adherence.”&mdash;Mr.

<p><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> I may, perhaps, state as showing how in the search for
truth men’s minds run in the same channels, and as, possibly,
some additional argument for the soundness of the proposals
thus combined, that, till I had got far on with my project, I
had not seen either the proposals of Professor Marshall or of
Wakefield (beyond a very short reference to the latter in J. S.
Mill’s “Elements of Political Economy”), nor had I seen the
work of Buckingham, which, published nearly fifty years ago,
seems to have attracted but little attention.</p></div>

meant; but one that occurs to my mind is that this assumption
of the continued growth of London forms one of the fundamental
premises of the Report of the Royal Commission on
Metropolitan Water Supply, 1893. On the contrary, it is
satisfactory to note that Mr. H. G. Wells has recently entirely
changed his views as to the future growth of London (<i>see</i> “Anticipations,”
chap. ii. ). Read also “The Distribution of Industry,” by P.
W. Wilson, in “the Heart of the Empire” (Fisher Unwin),
and Paper by Mr. W. L. Madgen, M.I.E.E., on “Industrial
Redistribution,” <i>Society of Arts Journal</i>, February, 1902. <i>See</i>
